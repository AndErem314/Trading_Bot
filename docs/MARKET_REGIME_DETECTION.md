# Market Regime Detection Documentation

## Overview

The Market Regime Detection feature provides real-time analysis of market conditions for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). It uses the sophisticated `CryptoMarketRegimeDetector` class to classify market states and help traders adapt their strategies accordingly.

## Market Regimes

The system identifies five distinct market regimes:

1. **Bull Trend** ðŸŸ¢
   - Strong, sustained upward momentum
   - ADX > 30 with positive directional movement
   - Ideal for trend-following strategies

2. **Bear Trend** ðŸ”´
   - Strong, sustained downward momentum
   - ADX > 30 with negative directional movement
   - Consider defensive strategies or short positions

3. **Ranging / Accumulation** ðŸŸ¡
   - Low volatility, sideways price action
   - ADX < 20 with normal volatility
   - Best for mean reversion strategies

4. **High Volatility / Breakout** ðŸŸ 
   - Rapidly expanding volatility
   - High ATR or Volume Z-scores
   - Reduce position sizes, wider stops needed

5. **Crypto Crash / Panic** ðŸ”´ðŸ”´
   - Extreme downward momentum with panic selling
   - Price < 200 SMA, RSI < 25, ROC < -20%
   - Maximum caution advised

   - 4 Hours: Medium-term (default)
   - 1 Day: Long-term regime detection

2. **Analysis Periods**:
   - 200 Periods: Recent analysis
   - 500 Periods: Standard analysis (default)
   - 1000 Periods: Extended historical analysis

### Strategy Recommendations by Regime

## Technical Details

The `CryptoMarketRegimeDetector` uses:
- ADX for trend strength measurement
- RSI for momentum and oversold/overbought conditions
- ATR Z-Score for volatility regime detection
- Volume Z-Score for unusual activity detection
- Rate of Change (ROC) for crash detection
- SMA 200 for long-term trend assessment

Asset-specific parameters are tuned for BTC, ETH, and general altcoins.

## Integration with Trading Strategies

See `backend/example_regime_strategy_integration.py` for examples of how to:
- Map strategies to different regimes
- Adjust risk parameters dynamically
- Create regime-aware trading systems

## Troubleshooting

1. **No Data Available Error**:
   - Ensure databases exist: `data/trading_data_BTC.db`, `data/trading_data_ETH.db`, `data/trading_data_SOL.db`
   - Run data collection first: `/update_data`

2. **Slow Loading**:
   - Reduce analysis periods
   - Use smaller timeframes
   - Check database performance

3. **Incorrect Regime Detection**:
   - Ensure sufficient historical data (minimum 200 periods)
   - Check for data gaps
   - Verify indicator calculations
