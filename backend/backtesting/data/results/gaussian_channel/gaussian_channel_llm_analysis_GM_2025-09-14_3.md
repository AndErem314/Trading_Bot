### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 67.72%

- **Max Drawdown**: 45.24%
- **Win Rate**: 64.42%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.27
- **Total Trades**: 267

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance metrics—a high win rate (64.42%) paired with a very high max drawdown (45.24%) and a low Sharpe ratio (0.69)—strongly suggest the strategy is winning many small trades in choppy markets but suffering large, infrequent losses when a strong trend develops. The optimization aims to correct this by making the strategy more defensive and selective.

1.  **Increasing `std_dev` to 2.5:** This is the most critical change. Widening the channel forces the strategy to wait for more statistically significant price deviations before entering a trade. This will filter out low-probability trades taken against a developing trend, directly targeting the source of the largest drawdowns. While this may reduce the total number of trades, it will substantially improve the quality of each entry, boosting the profit factor and Sharpe ratio.

2.  **Increasing `period` to 25:** A longer lookback period for the channel's baseline will make it less reactive to short-term price noise and more aligned with the intermediate-term trend. This prevents the strategy from being 'whipsawed' in volatile but directionless periods and helps the channel adapt more smoothly during sustained price movements.

3.  **Setting `adaptive` to `true`:** The market analysis shows a 'bullish' trend with very low 'consistency,' indicating a choppy, volatile environment. An adaptive channel, which likely adjusts its width based on recent volatility, is essential here. It will automatically widen during volatile trending phases (making the strategy more cautious and preventing bad entries) and narrow during consolidations (allowing it to capture smaller, higher-probability mean-reversion trades). This dynamic adjustment is key to improving risk-adjusted returns across different market regimes.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "period": 25,
  "std_dev": 2.5,
  "adaptive": true
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound / consolidating markets
- Markets with clear mean-reverting tendencies
- Low-to-normal volatility environments without a strong, persistent trend

### Risk Assessment
The strategy's primary risk is its vulnerability to strong, trending markets. The current maximum drawdown of 45.24% is unacceptably high and indicates the strategy is taking significant losses when fighting a persistent trend. This is a classic failure mode for mean-reversion strategies. The low Profit Factor of 1.27 suggests that winning trades are only marginally larger than losing trades, making the strategy's profitability highly sensitive to small changes in win rate or transaction costs. The strategy must be re-parameterized to be more selective in its trade entries to avoid these high-risk, trend-following environments.
