### Optimization Recommendations

The primary goal is to drastically reduce the maximum drawdown and improve the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio). The current parameters are too aggressive for the observed market conditions.

1.  **Increasing `std_dev` from 2.5 to 3.0:** This is the most critical change. It widens the channel, requiring a more significant price deviation before a trade is initiated. This will filter out lower-probability signals generated by market noise and small pullbacks within the strong trend. The result should be fewer, but higher-quality, trades, which is the key to reducing the frequency of entries against the trend and thus lowering the maximum drawdown.

2.  **Decreasing `period` from 25 to 20:** The current period of 25 makes the channel's centerline (mean) react slowly to price changes. In a choppy but directional market, a slightly shorter period of 20 will make the channel more responsive to recent price action. This allows the strategy to adapt more quickly to short-term trend shifts, reducing the time spent fighting the underlying market momentum.

3.  **Retaining `adaptive: true`:** In a market with 'normal' volatility, an adaptive component is beneficial. It allows the channel to widen during volatility spikes, providing a natural, dynamic risk management mechanism by preventing entries during periods of extreme uncertainty. Disabling this would make the strategy too rigid.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "period": 20,
  "std_dev": 3.0,
  "adaptive": true
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound markets with clear support and resistance levels
- Low to normal volatility consolidation periods
- Markets exhibiting high trend consistency (i.e., less choppy trends)

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy configuration carries an extremely high level of risk, evidenced by the 53.91% maximum drawdown. This level of drawdown is unacceptable for most investment mandates as it can lead to catastrophic capital loss. The low Sharpe Ratio of 0.33 indicates that the returns do not compensate for the risk taken. The core risk stems from the strategy's apparent mean-reversion nature, which performs poorly in markets with a strong, albeit choppy, directional bias, as seen in the market analysis (strong trend, low consistency). The strategy is repeatedly entering positions against the primary trend, leading to small wins but occasional, very large losses that decimate profits.
