## gaussian_channel Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 6771.96%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.69
- **Max Drawdown**: 45.24%
- **Win Rate**: 64.42%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.27
- **Total Trades**: 267

### Optimization Recommendations

The goal of this optimization is to enhance risk-adjusted returns by prioritizing capital preservation. The current performance suggests the strategy is too sensitive to market noise.
1.  **`period`: 25**: Increasing the lookback period from a likely shorter default (e.g., 20) will create a smoother, less reactive channel. This helps the strategy focus on the primary, more established trend and ignore the short-term, inconsistent pullbacks identified in the market analysis.
2.  **`std_dev`: 2.5**: Widening the channel by increasing the standard deviation is the most direct way to reduce drawdown. A value of 2.5 (up from a likely default of 2.0) sets a higher threshold for trade entry, effectively filtering for higher-probability signals. This will reduce the number of trades taken during minor pullbacks and prevent premature stop-outs during volatility spikes, directly targeting the cause of the high drawdown and low Profit Factor.
3.  **`adaptive`: true**: Enabling the adaptive mode is critical for the observed market conditions. An adaptive channel will dynamically widen during periods of high volatility (like the sharp pullbacks) and tighten during calmer periods. This protects capital when risk is high and allows for more aggressive positioning when the trend is smooth and stable, directly addressing the market's 'inconsistent' nature.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "period": 25,
  "std_dev": 2.5,
  "adaptive": true
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strongly trending markets (bullish or bearish)
- Markets with normal-to-high volatility where trends are sustained
- Less suitable for low-volatility, range-bound, or choppy markets

### Risk Assessment
The strategy's primary risk is its exceptionally high maximum drawdown of 45.24%, which is unacceptable for most risk mandates. This indicates a severe vulnerability to sharp counter-trend movements or volatility spikes, even within a broadly bullish market. The low Sharpe Ratio of 0.69 confirms that the impressive total return does not adequately compensate for the risk undertaken. The 'inconsistent' trend character (-83.5) and 'decreasing' volume trend are warning signs; the market's conviction is waning, which could lead to more whipsaws and failed trend-following signals. The current parameter set likely generates signals too early or holds onto positions through deep pullbacks, exacerbating losses.
