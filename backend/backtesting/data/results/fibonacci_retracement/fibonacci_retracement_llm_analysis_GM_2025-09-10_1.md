## fibonacci_retracement Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: -9903.65%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -6.29
- **Max Drawdown**: 99.12%
- **Win Rate**: 23.83%
- **Profit Factor**: 0.49
- **Total Trades**: 1221

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters are empty, implying a poorly designed backtesting setup. The suggested parameters aim to address this by: 

1. **Reducing Lookback Period:** A shorter `lookback_period` of 50 reduces sensitivity to noise in longer-term price movements.  Longer lookback periods can be detrimental in volatile markets which this market shows signs of having (high volatility, large price range). 

2. **Focusing Fib Levels:** Using only the 0.382 and 0.618 Fibonacci levels simplifies the strategy, reducing the number of potential trade entries and focusing on statistically significant retracement levels.  The current market shows a bullish trend and these levels are usually considered to provide stronger reversal points.  Adding more levels increases the chance of false signals. 

Further, the Market Conditions Analysis suggests a bullish trend, even though the consistency is negative, suggesting that the current strategy might be poorly aligned with the dominant market trend or it requires a different trade management structure. These changes should increase the win rate and improve the Sharpe Ratio. The extremely high maximum drawdown suggests that risk management within the strategy is completely inadequate, which should be addressed along with parameter optimization.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "lookback_period": 50,
  "fib_levels": [
    0.382,
    0.618
  ]
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- High Volatility Trending Markets (bullish)
- Moderate Volatility Trending Markets (bullish)

### Risk Assessment
The current backtesting results indicate a severely underperforming strategy.  The -9903.65% total return, -6.29 Sharpe ratio, and 99.12% maximum drawdown highlight significant flaws.  The low win rate (23.83%) and profit factor (0.49) confirm the strategy's ineffectiveness.  Before implementing any optimization, a thorough review of the trading logic and error handling is crucial.  There's a strong possibility of bugs in the code or a fundamental misunderstanding of the Fibonacci retracement application in the given market conditions. The suggested parameters focus on reducing complexity and focusing on the most significant retracement levels, but significant improvements may require a fundamental strategy redesign.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
