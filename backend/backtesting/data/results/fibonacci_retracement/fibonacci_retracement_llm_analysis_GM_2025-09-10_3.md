## fibonacci_retracement Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: -9602.16%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -4.38
- **Max Drawdown**: 96.16%
- **Win Rate**: 24.77%
- **Profit Factor**: 0.48
- **Total Trades**: 864

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy uses too many Fibonacci levels and a potentially too-long lookback period.  This leads to frequent, often losing, trades. 

Reducing the number of Fibonacci levels to 0.382, 0.5, and 0.618 focuses on the most statistically significant retracement levels. This reduces the likelihood of entering trades based on less reliable levels.  A shorter lookback period of 50 reduces the sensitivity to longer-term noise and improves responsiveness to more immediate price action within a trend. The current market's consistency is very low; hence focusing on short-term trends can be helpful.

Reducing the lookback period also helps reduce transaction costs which might have cumulatively impacted the strategy's performance given the high number of trades (864). The decreasing volume trend suggests that the market might be less efficient, hence, a shorter lookback period is better suited to capture price swings.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "lookback_period": 50,
  "fib_levels": [
    0.382,
    0.5,
    0.618
  ]
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- High volatility trending markets
- Strong trending markets (bullish or bearish)

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits extremely poor performance, indicated by a negative Sharpe ratio of -4.38 and a massive -9602.16% total return.  The high maximum drawdown of 96.16% suggests significant risk and potential for substantial losses. The low win rate (24.77%) and profit factor (0.48) confirm the strategy's ineffectiveness.  Any optimization needs to drastically improve these metrics.  There's a considerable risk that even with parameter optimization, this strategy might still be unprofitable or highly volatile.  Robust position sizing and risk management (stop-loss orders) are absolutely critical, regardless of parameter settings.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
