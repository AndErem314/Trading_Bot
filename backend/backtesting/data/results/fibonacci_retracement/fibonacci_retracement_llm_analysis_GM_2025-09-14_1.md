## fibonacci_retracement Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: -9903.65%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -6.29
- **Max Drawdown**: 99.12%
- **Win Rate**: 23.83%
- **Profit Factor**: 0.49
- **Total Trades**: 1221

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance indicates a catastrophic failure of the entry logic. A win rate of 23.83% and a profit factor of 0.49 suggest that the strategy is systematically entering trades prematurely during pullbacks, only for the price to move further against the position.

1.  **Adjusting `lookback_period` to 50:** The default period is likely too long, anchoring the Fibonacci levels to outdated highs and lows. A shorter lookback period of 50 makes the strategy more adaptive to the recent market structure. In a choppy and inconsistent trend, focusing on more recent price swings allows for more relevant support/resistance levels to be drawn, increasing the probability of a successful trade.

2.  **Expanding `fib_levels` to include 0.786:** This is the most critical recommendation. The market's pullbacks are evidently deeper than what standard Fibonacci levels account for. By adding the 0.786 level, we compel the strategy to wait for a more significant price correction before initiating a trade. This acts as a patience filter, aiming to enter only when the retracement is substantial, which should drastically improve the entry quality, increase the win rate, and subsequently lift the Profit Factor and Sharpe Ratio out of their deeply negative territory.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "lookback_period": 50,
  "fib_levels": [
    0.236,
    0.382,
    0.5,
    0.618,
    0.786
  ]
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strongly trending markets with high consistency (e.g., consistency score > 20)
- Markets exhibiting clear impulse and corrective wave structures
- Moderate to high volatility environments where pullbacks are respected

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy configuration is uninvestable, posing a near-certain risk of total capital loss, as evidenced by the 99.12% maximum drawdown and a Sharpe Ratio of -6.29. The primary risk is a fundamental mismatch between the strategy's logic and the prevailing market character. The strategy expects smooth, predictable retracements in a trend, but the market analysis reveals a trend with extremely poor consistency (-83.53), implying sharp, deep, and unpredictable price swings. This 'Trend Inconsistency Risk' is the root cause of the strategy's failure, causing it to repeatedly enter trades that are immediately stopped out. Optimization carries the risk of overfitting, where parameters are tuned too closely to historical data and fail in live market conditions. Any forward deployment must be accompanied by rigorous out-of-sample testing.
