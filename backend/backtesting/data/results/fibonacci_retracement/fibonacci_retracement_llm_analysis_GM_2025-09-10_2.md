## fibonacci_retracement Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: -9903.65%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -6.29
- **Max Drawdown**: 99.12%
- **Win Rate**: 23.83%
- **Profit Factor**: 0.49
- **Total Trades**: 1221

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters are completely unspecified, resulting in disastrous performance. The suggested changes are based on a logical reduction in complexity and a focus on capturing stronger trend reversals.  Reducing the `fib_levels` to just 0.382 and 0.618 is intended to filter out less significant retracements and increase the focus on key reversal points, improving the win rate. A `lookback_period` of 50 provides a balance between capturing trend information and responsiveness to market changes, avoiding overfitting to noise.  The market analysis indicates bullish trends; therefore, focusing on retracement levels within a primarily upward movement makes sense.  The decreasing volume also suggests that this strategy might work best in environments that are trending rather than consolidating.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "lookback_period": 50,
  "fib_levels": [
    0.382,
    0.618
  ]
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- High Volatility Trending Markets (bullish)
- Periods of strong bullish momentum within trending markets

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits extremely poor performance, indicated by a -9903.65% total return, -6.29 Sharpe ratio, and a 99.12% maximum drawdown.  This suggests a fundamental flaw in the strategy's design or parameterization for the backtested data.  The low win rate (23.83%) and low profit factor (0.49) further confirm the significant risk and lack of profitability.  The suggested parameter changes aim to mitigate risk and improve the Sharpe ratio, but significant improvements may require more substantial adjustments to the strategy itself.  Risk remains high due to the inherent volatility of the market and the potentially flawed core strategy.  Further testing and diversification are crucial before deploying this strategy with real capital.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
