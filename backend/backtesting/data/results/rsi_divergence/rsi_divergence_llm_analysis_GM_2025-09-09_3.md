## rsi_divergence Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 5828.49%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.67
- **Max Drawdown**: 47.78%
- **Win Rate**: 68.75%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.81
- **Total Trades**: 16

### Optimization Recommendations

The suggested parameter adjustments aim to improve the strategy's risk-adjusted returns and robustness.  The current RSI parameters are relatively aggressive (length=18, oversold=29, overbought=72).  Reducing the `rsi_length` makes the RSI more responsive to shorter-term price movements. Slightly widening the `rsi_oversold` and `rsi_overbought` parameters reduces the frequency of false signals arising from short-term noise.  Reducing the `rsi_sma_fast` and increasing `rsi_sma_slow` will smoothen out the RSI signals and reduce whipsaws. Increasing the `momentum_lookback` will provide more reliable momentum confirmation, and increasing the `divergence_lookback` will improve the identification of reliable divergences.  These adjustments should improve the Sharpe ratio by increasing consistency of profits while limiting losses by filtering out many false signals.  The slight reduction in total return is acceptable to achieve a significant reduction in risk.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_sma_fast": 5,
  "rsi_sma_slow": 10,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75,
  "momentum_lookback": 6,
  "divergence_lookback": 20
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Bullish trending markets with moderate volatility
- Markets with clear price action and less noise

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits a high maximum drawdown (47.78%) despite a high total return. This indicates significant risk and potential for substantial losses.  The relatively low Sharpe ratio (0.67) further supports this. The small number of total trades (16) also makes the results less statistically significant, meaning there's a higher chance of overfitting.  Parameter optimization aims to improve the Sharpe ratio and reduce the maximum drawdown by increasing the consistency of profits and reducing the impact of losing trades.  The focus will be on tightening the thresholds to reduce false signals and increase precision.  Increased statistical significance would require more extensive backtesting.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
