## rsi_divergence Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 7983.69%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.75
- **Max Drawdown**: 43.59%
- **Win Rate**: 56.67%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.80
- **Total Trades**: 30

### Optimization Recommendations

The suggested parameter changes aim to improve the Sharpe ratio and reduce maximum drawdown.  A shorter `rsi_length` (14) is a common starting point for RSI calculations, providing a more responsive indicator to recent price action.  The `rsi_sma_fast` and `rsi_sma_slow` values are chosen to provide a balance between responsiveness and smoothing. Adjusting `rsi_oversold` and `rsi_overbought` aims to refine the signal generation, potentially reducing false signals that contribute to drawdowns.  `momentum_lookback` and `divergence_lookback` values are selected based on a balance between identifying true divergences and reacting quickly to market changes. Reducing `divergence_lookback` helps to improve timeliness while the `momentum_lookback` influences the sensitivity of momentum identification.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_sma_fast": 5,
  "rsi_sma_slow": 10,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75,
  "momentum_lookback": 5,
  "divergence_lookback": 20
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Trending markets (both bullish and bearish)
- Markets with periods of consolidation followed by strong directional moves

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits a high maximum drawdown (43.59%), which is a significant concern despite the high total return.  The relatively low Sharpe ratio (0.75) further indicates suboptimal risk-adjusted returns. The low number of trades (30) limits the statistical significance of the backtest results, and over-optimization is a potential risk.  Improving the Sharpe ratio is crucial to enhance the strategy's robustness and reduce the risk of large drawdowns.  Further testing with more data is highly recommended before live deployment. We need to focus on reducing the drawdown without significantly impacting the win rate or profit factor.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
