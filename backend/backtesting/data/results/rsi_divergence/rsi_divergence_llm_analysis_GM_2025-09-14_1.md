- **Max Drawdown**: 43.59%
- **Win Rate**: 56.67%

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance shows a strategy that captures massive wins but at the cost of high volatility and severe drawdowns, reflected in the low Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. The optimization goal is to improve the quality of trade signals to enhance risk-adjusted returns.

1.  **Stricter Entry Criteria (`rsi_oversold`, `rsi_overbought`):** By moving the oversold/overbought levels from the standard 30/70 to a more extreme 25/75, we demand a more pronounced market exhaustion before considering a signal. This should filter out weaker setups and reduce entries into consolidations that are mistaken for reversals, thereby lowering drawdown.

2.  **Reducing Noise (`rsi_length`, `momentum_lookback`):** Increasing the RSI length to 18 and the momentum lookback to 7 will smooth the input data. This makes the indicators less sensitive to short-term price noise, ensuring that divergences are identified on more significant market structures. This prioritizes higher-probability signals over trade frequency.

3.  **Improving Confirmation (`rsi_sma_fast`, `rsi_sma_slow`, `divergence_lookback`):** Widening the gap between the RSI's moving averages (5/12) creates a more robust confirmation trigger. Shortening the `divergence_lookback` to 20 focuses the strategy on more recent and actionable price behavior, potentially reducing the time spent in losing positions waiting for a long-term divergence to play out.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "rsi_length": 18,
  "rsi_sma_fast": 5,
  "rsi_sma_slow": 12,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75,
  "momentum_lookback": 7,
  "divergence_lookback": 20
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, long-term trending markets (particularly bullish).
- Markets with moderate-to-high volatility that create significant pullbacks and 'buy the dip' opportunities.
- Ineffective or high-risk in range-bound or consistently bearish markets without modification.

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk is the statistical insignificance of the results. With only 30 trades, the stellar 7983% total return could be the result of a few outlier trades or luck, rather than a robust edge. This small sample size makes the strategy highly susceptible to curve-fitting. The second major risk is the extreme Maximum Drawdown of 43.59%. This level of capital erosion is unacceptable for most investment mandates and indicates a severe lack of effective risk management (e.g., no stop-loss or a very wide one). The strategy is inherently contrarian, attempting to catch falling knives, which is a high-risk approach. Its performance is also heavily dependent on the specific market regime observed (a strong but volatile bull run); it would likely suffer significant losses in a sustained bear market.
