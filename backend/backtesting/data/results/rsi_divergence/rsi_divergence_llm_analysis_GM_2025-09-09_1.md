## rsi_divergence Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 7983.69%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.75
- **Max Drawdown**: 43.59%
- **Win Rate**: 56.67%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.80
- **Total Trades**: 30

### Optimization Recommendations

The suggested parameters aim to improve the Sharpe ratio and reduce maximum drawdown.  The current Sharpe ratio is low, suggesting high volatility in returns.  The relatively short RSI lengths (between 10 and 20) with the standard fast and slow SMAs can result in numerous whipsaws; the suggestion increase in the RSI length (14) aims to filter out some of this noise and offer more smoothed signals.  Adjusting the RSI overbought/oversold levels to 75/25 helps to mitigate this while still capturing enough trading signals.  A 7-period momentum lookback provides a balance between responsiveness and noise reduction. A divergence lookback of 20 is deemed appropriate based on the market condition of the price ranging and potential trend reversals.  Further optimization could be done to find out the best setting across all parameters, but this suggestion offers a starting point based on the provided information and usual RSI settings.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_sma_fast": 5,
  "rsi_sma_slow": 10,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75,
  "momentum_lookback": 7,
  "divergence_lookback": 20
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Bullish trending markets with normal volatility
- Markets with moderate to high volume

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy shows a high total return but suffers from a significant maximum drawdown (43.59%). This indicates a potential for substantial losses. The Sharpe ratio of 0.75 is also relatively low, suggesting that the returns are not well compensated for the risk taken.  The low number of total trades (30) may lead to unreliable backtesting results and higher variance, reducing the confidence in the statistics.  Improving the Sharpe ratio and reducing the drawdown are crucial before considering deployment. The analysis below focuses on achieving this without drastically reducing the total return.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
