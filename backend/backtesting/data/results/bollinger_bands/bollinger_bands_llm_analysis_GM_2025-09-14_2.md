  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance, characterized by a high win rate (60%) but a negative Sharpe Ratio (-2.24) and a Profit Factor below 1, is a classic symptom of a mean-reversion strategy fighting a strong trend. The strategy is correctly identifying minor pullbacks but is being severely punished on the trades that fail when the trend resumes. The optimization reasoning is as follows:

1.  **Widen Bollinger Bands (`bb_std`: 2.0 -> 2.5):** In a strong trend, prices can 'walk the band' for extended periods. Increasing the standard deviation requires a much more significant price extension away from the mean to trigger a signal. This will filter out low-probability trades and focus only on moments of genuine over-extension, which have a higher chance of reverting. This is the single most important change to reduce drawdown and improve the quality of each trade.

2.  **Lengthen Lookback Periods (`bb_length`: 20 -> 25, `rsi_length`: 12 -> 14):** Using longer lookback periods for both the Bollinger Bands and RSI makes the indicators less sensitive to short-term price noise. This helps the strategy focus on a more significant, longer-term mean and momentum, preventing premature entries against the primary trend.

3.  **Asymmetrical RSI Thresholds (`rsi_oversold`: 35, `rsi_overbought`: 75):** The market is in a strong bullish trend. Therefore, we must adapt. Raising the `rsi_overbought` threshold to 75 makes it significantly harder to initiate a short (counter-trend) position, requiring extreme buying exhaustion. Conversely, keeping the `rsi_oversold` at a less extreme level like 35 allows the strategy to enter long positions on shallower dips, which are common in a strong uptrend. This aligns the strategy's entry logic with the prevailing market direction.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 25,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 35,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound markets with normal to high volatility
- Weakly trending or choppy markets where price oscillates around a mean
- Markets showing signs of trend exhaustion after a prolonged move

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk for this strategy is strong, persistent trending markets. The current negative performance is a clear indicator that its mean-reversion logic is failing in the prevailing bullish trend. The strategy is designed to sell strength and buy weakness, which leads to repeated small wins but catastrophic losses when the trend does not revert. The suggested parameter changes aim to mitigate this 'trend risk' by making the entry signals far more selective. However, this introduces a secondary risk of 'overfitting' to the backtest period and potentially reducing the total number of trades, which could lead to lower returns in more suitable, range-bound market conditions. A sudden shift from a trending to a ranging market might not be captured effectively with these more conservative parameters.
