## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 0.58%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -2.61
- **Max Drawdown**: 1.31%
- **Win Rate**: 68.42%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.59
- **Total Trades**: 19

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance is poor due to a mismatch between the strategy's mean-reversion nature and the market's bullish trend. The parameters are too slow and wide, resulting in very few trades and exposure to large losses when the trend does not revert. My recommendations are designed to address this:

1.  **Increase Trade Frequency and Sensitivity:** Reducing `bb_length` from 25 to 20 and `bb_std` from 2.5 to 2.0 will make the bands tighter and more responsive to recent price action. This will significantly increase the number of trading opportunities, providing a more statistically robust backtest and potentially increasing total return.

2.  **Improve Entry Signal Quality:** The current `rsi_oversold` of 40 is too permissive, allowing long entries on minor dips that may not be truly oversold. Lowering it to the standard of 30 provides a stricter filter, ensuring the strategy only enters on more significant pullbacks, which have a higher probability of reverting. This is key to cutting the large losses that are destroying the Sharpe Ratio.

3.  **Standardize and Align Indicators:** Changing `rsi_length` from 18 to 14 (a common standard) and `rsi_overbought` from 80 to 70 aligns the confirmation indicator's speed and sensitivity with the newly adjusted, faster Bollinger Bands. This ensures better synchronization between the entry signal and its confirmation.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound / consolidating markets
- High volatility without a strong directional trend
- Markets exhibiting clear mean-reversion characteristics

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk of the current strategy is its poor performance in a strongly trending market, as evidenced by the market analysis. A negative Sharpe Ratio (-2.61) combined with a high Win Rate (68.42%) strongly suggests that the strategy generates many small wins but suffers from infrequent, large losses that erase all profits and more. This is a classic 'picking up pennies in front of a steamroller' risk profile. Furthermore, the extremely low trade count (19) indicates a high risk of curve-fitting and statistical insignificance; the results may not be representative of future performance. The suggested optimizations aim to mitigate these risks by increasing trade frequency and improving the quality of entry signals, but the fundamental risk of using a mean-reversion strategy against a strong trend remains.
