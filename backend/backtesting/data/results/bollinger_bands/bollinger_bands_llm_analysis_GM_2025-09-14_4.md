## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 0.58%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -2.61
- **Max Drawdown**: 1.31%
- **Win Rate**: 68.42%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.59
- **Total Trades**: 19

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters are too slow and insensitive for the observed market conditions, leading to poor performance. 
1.  **Reduce `bb_length` (25 -> 20) and `bb_std` (2.5 -> 2.0):** The current settings create wide, slow-moving bands, resulting in very few trading signals (19 trades). By making the bands tighter and more responsive to recent price action, the strategy can capture more frequent, smaller-scale mean-reversion opportunities and increase the trade count for more reliable statistical analysis. Standard parameters (20, 2.0) are a better starting point.
2.  **Adjust RSI Parameters (`rsi_length`: 18->14, `rsi_oversold`: 40->30, `rsi_overbought`: 80->70):** The current `rsi_oversold` of 40 is extremely aggressive, causing the strategy to buy into weakness long before a bottom is confirmed, likely leading to large drawdowns on losing trades. Lowering it to a more standard 30 will enforce stricter entry discipline, ensuring buys only occur on more significant dips. Similarly, adjusting the length and overbought levels to more conventional values (14 and 70) will create a more balanced and reactive confirmation indicator that aligns better with the more responsive Bollinger Bands.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound, consolidating markets
- High volatility, mean-reverting environments

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk for this strategy is trend continuation. As a mean-reversion strategy, it inherently underperforms in strong, persistent trends, which is reflected in the current backtest against a 'bullish' market. The extremely poor Sharpe Ratio (-2.61) despite a high Win Rate (68.42%) indicates that the few losing trades are catastrophically large, wiping out the many small wins. This suggests a flawed risk management system where trades against the trend are held for too long. Furthermore, with only 19 total trades, the results are not statistically significant, and there is a very high risk of parameter overfitting. The strategy's performance is highly sensitive to market regime changes.
