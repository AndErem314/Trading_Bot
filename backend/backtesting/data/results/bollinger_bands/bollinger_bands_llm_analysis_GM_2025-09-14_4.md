### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "bb_length": 30,
  "bb_std": 3.0,
  "rsi_length": 18,
  "rsi_oversold": 40,
  "rsi_overbought": 80
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy's core issue is an extremely low trade count (14), which makes the performance metrics statistically unreliable. The parameters are overly conservative, waiting for a 'perfect' setup that rarely occurs. The optimization focuses on increasing trade frequency to a meaningful level while preserving the logic that yields a high win rate and profit factor.

1.  **Bollinger Bands (`bb_length`: 30->20, `bb_std`: 3.0->2.0):** This is the most critical adjustment. Reducing the standard deviation from 3.0 (an extreme statistical outlier) to the standard 2.0, and shortening the lookback period, will make the bands significantly tighter and more responsive to price. This will dramatically increase the number of times the price touches the bands, thus generating more trading signals.

2.  **RSI Filter (`rsi_length`: 18->14, `rsi_oversold/overbought`: 40/80 -> 30/70):** The current RSI settings are too slow and demand extreme conditions. Adjusting to the standard 14-period RSI with 30/70 thresholds aligns the confirmation indicator's sensitivity with the newly adjusted Bollinger Bands. This ensures the filter confirms more of the valid signals generated by the bands, rather than acting as a barrier.

Collectively, these changes transform the strategy from a passive, outlier-capture model into a more active mean-reversion system designed to capitalize on more frequent oscillations, which should improve the Sharpe Ratio and Total Return significantly.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Ranging or consolidating markets with high-to-normal volatility.
- With-trend entries during pullbacks in moderately trending markets.
- Markets with decreasing volume, which can signal trend exhaustion and increase the probability of mean reversion.

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk is a strong, persistent market trend. The current backtest occurred in a bullish market, but the strategy's extremely conservative parameters likely filtered out most losing trades. The suggested, more sensitive parameters will increase trade frequency, heightening the risk of entering counter-trend positions that result in significant losses (i.e., shorting in a powerful uptrend). A secondary risk is a sudden regime change to low volatility, which would cause the bands to tighten and reduce trading opportunities, a phenomenon known as a 'volatility squeeze'. Finally, there is a risk of overfitting; these parameters must be validated on out-of-sample data.
