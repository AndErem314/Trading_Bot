## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 11.60%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -2.63
- **Max Drawdown**: 0.81%
- **Win Rate**: 62.50%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.10
- **Total Trades**: 112

### Optimization Recommendations

The current negative Sharpe ratio is the primary concern.  Increasing `bb_std` from 2.0 to 2.5 widens the Bollinger Bands, leading to fewer trades and potentially filtering out noisy signals. This should reduce the number of losing trades, improving the Sharpe ratio.  Slightly altering the RSI overbought/oversold levels to 70/30 respectively aims to improve the trade selection and potentially reduce drawdown by avoiding entry into weak trades near oversold/overbought levels.  Increasing `bb_length` to 25 provides a smoother indication of volatility and price trends, improving signal quality and reducing false signals. The market conditions analysis shows a 'decreasing volume' trend, which correlates with less impulsive price movements; this parameter adjustments would better suit such a market.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 25,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Normal Volatility Bullish Markets with Decreasing Volume
- Mildly Trending Markets with Established Support and Resistance Levels

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits a negative Sharpe ratio, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.  The low maximum drawdown suggests resilience in relatively calm markets, but the negative Sharpe ratio highlights the need for parameter optimization to improve risk management.  The low profit factor and negative Sharpe ratio point toward potential overtrading. The suggested parameter changes aim to reduce the frequency of losing trades while maintaining profitability. Increasing the `bb_std` expands the bands, reducing the frequency of signals, potentially mitigating overtrading. Adjusting the RSI parameters slightly broadens the range for holding positions. This strategy is highly sensitive to market regime shifts and should be actively monitored for changes in volatility and trend.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
