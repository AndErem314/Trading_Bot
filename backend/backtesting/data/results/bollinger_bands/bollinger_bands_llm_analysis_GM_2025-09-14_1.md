### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance indicates a fundamental mismatch between the strategy's logic and the market environment. The goal of this optimization is to transform the strategy from a generic mean-reversion system into a more intelligent 'buy-the-dip' system that respects the primary trend.

1.  **Increasing `bb_length` to 25 and `bb_std` to 2.5:** In a volatile and trending market, standard Bollinger Bands (e.g., 20, 2.0) are too narrow. This leads to frequent, low-quality signals and 'whipsaws'. Widening the bands by increasing both the lookback period and standard deviation will filter out market noise. Trades will be less frequent but will trigger only on more significant price extensions, improving the quality and potential profitability of each signal.

2.  **Increasing `rsi_length` to 18:** A longer RSI lookback period smooths the indicator, making it less susceptible to short-term noise and better at identifying the durable underlying momentum, which is crucial in a choppy trend.

3.  **Adjusting RSI Thresholds (`rsi_oversold` to 40, `rsi_overbought` to 80):** This is the most critical change. In a strong bull market, pullbacks are often shallow and do not reach traditional 'oversold' levels like 30. By raising the `rsi_oversold` threshold to 40, we can identify and enter on these more realistic dip-buying opportunities. Conversely, an RSI can remain 'overbought' (>70) for extended periods in an uptrend. Shorting in this condition is extremely risky. By raising the `rsi_overbought` threshold to 80, we make short signals exceptionally rare, effectively preventing the strategy from fighting the powerful primary trend. This single change is expected to have the largest positive impact on the Sharpe Ratio and Profit Factor.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 25,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 18,
  "rsi_oversold": 40,
  "rsi_overbought": 80
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Trending markets with high volatility and significant pullbacks
- Range-bound markets with clear support and resistance levels
- Bull markets where 'buying the dip' is a viable strategy

### Risk Assessment
The strategy's primary risk is its inherent mean-reversion nature, which performs poorly in strong, consistent trends. The current negative Sharpe Ratio (-2.63) indicates the strategy is actively fighting the observed 'bullish' trend, likely by initiating short trades on strength which then fail as the trend resumes. The high win rate (62.50%) combined with a near-breakeven Profit Factor (1.10) confirms that the strategy is likely securing many small wins but suffering from infrequent, larger losses that erase all gains and more on a risk-adjusted basis. My suggested parameter changes aim to mitigate this 'trend risk' by making the strategy more selective and aligned with the underlying bullish market structure. However, the risk of parameter overfitting remains; these settings may underperform if the market regime shifts to a strong bear trend or a low-volatility environment.
