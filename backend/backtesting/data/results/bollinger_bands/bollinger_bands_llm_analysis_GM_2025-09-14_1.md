### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "bb_length": 25,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy's performance is extremely poor (Sharpe Ratio: -1.33), primarily because its parameters are too conservative for the analyzed market conditions, resulting in only 39 trades. The combination of a long `bb_length` (25) and a wide `bb_std` (2.5) creates bands that are rarely touched, starving the strategy of opportunities.

My recommendations are designed to make the strategy more active and responsive:
1.  **Reduce `bb_length` to 20 and `bb_std` to 2.0:** This will tighten the bands around the price, making them more sensitive to recent volatility. It will significantly increase the number of times the price touches the bands, thus generating more trading signals. This is the most critical change to move from a passive to an active strategy.
2.  **Reduce `rsi_length` to 12:** A shorter RSI lookback period makes the oscillator more sensitive to recent price momentum, allowing for earlier entry signals that align better with the more frequent signals from the tighter Bollinger Bands.
3.  **Adjust RSI Thresholds (`rsi_oversold`: 35, `rsi_overbought`: 70):** In a strong bull market, prices rarely reach deep oversold levels (like 25). Raising the `rsi_oversold` threshold to 35 will allow the strategy to enter long trades on smaller, more frequent dips. Conversely, lowering the `rsi_overbought` to 70 allows for quicker profit-taking on longs. This asymmetric adjustment favors entering longs, which is appropriate for the observed bullish trend.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 12,
  "rsi_oversold": 35,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound or sideways markets
- High volatility, non-trending environments
- Moderately trending markets with significant pullbacks

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk of the current strategy is its passivity and opportunity cost, evident from the extremely low trade count (39) and near-zero return. The suggested parameter changes aim to increase trade frequency, which inherently carries risks. A tighter Bollinger Band (std=2.0) and more sensitive RSI will generate more signals, but could also lead to more 'whipsaws' in choppy markets. The win rate will likely decrease from its current 61.54%, but the goal is to increase the overall profitability (Profit Factor and Sharpe Ratio) by capturing more winning trades that are larger than the increased number of losing trades. The most significant risk is continuing to deploy a mean-reversion strategy (shorting at the upper band) in a strong bull market. This can lead to significant losses on the short side, potentially increasing the maximum drawdown if a stop-loss is not used. The new parameters must be validated with a follow-up backtest, with close attention paid to the performance of short vs. long trades.
