## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 0.12%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -2.63
- **Max Drawdown**: 0.81%
- **Win Rate**: 62.50%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.10
- **Total Trades**: 112

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance profile (high win rate, low profit factor, negative Sharpe) is a classic sign of over-trading and poor risk-reward. The strategy is winning often but not making money, likely taking profit too early on small reversions while getting caught in larger moves. The proposed optimization addresses this by making the entry criteria more stringent:

1.  **Wider Bands (`bb_length`: 25, `bb_std`: 2.5):** Increasing the lookback period and standard deviation requires a more significant price deviation to trigger a signal. This will filter out market noise, reduce the total number of trades, and focus on higher-probability reversion opportunities. This should directly improve the profit factor and, by extension, the Sharpe ratio.

2.  **More Extreme RSI Levels (`rsi_oversold`: 25, `rsi_overbought`: 75):** In a choppy but bullish market, short signals are inherently risky. Raising the `rsi_overbought` threshold to 75 demands a much stronger overextension before initiating a short, reducing the chance of fighting a strong uptrend. Similarly, lowering `rsi_oversold` to 25 ensures long entries are taken only on more significant dips, offering a better potential risk-reward ratio.

3.  **Smoother RSI (`rsi_length`: 16):** A slightly longer RSI period will smooth the indicator, making it less prone to generating premature signals in volatile conditions.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 25,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 16,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound, non-trending markets
- High-volatility consolidation phases
- Choppy markets with strong mean-reversion characteristics

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk for this mean-reversion strategy is a strong, sustained trend. The current negative Sharpe Ratio, despite a high win rate, indicates that the strategy is likely suffering from a few large losses that erase many small gains. This happens when the market begins to trend and does not revert to the mean as expected. The analyzed market condition ('bullish' but with low 'consistency') is particularly challenging, as the strategy is fighting the underlying upward pressure on its short trades. The suggested parameter changes aim to mitigate this by being more selective, but trend risk remains the most significant threat. Overfitting is another key risk; these parameters must be validated on out-of-sample data.
