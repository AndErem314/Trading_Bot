### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "bb_length": 25,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 35,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance indicates the strategy is being penalized for fighting the strong bullish trend. The optimization goal is to increase signal quality and avoid counter-trend trades that result in large drawdowns. 
1. **Increasing `bb_length` to 30 and `bb_std` to 3.0**: This makes the Bollinger Bands wider and less sensitive to short-term price fluctuations. It requires a much more significant deviation from the mean to generate a signal, effectively filtering out noise and weak signals that occur when a security 'walks the band' in a strong trend. This directly targets reducing the large losing trades, which will improve both Max Drawdown and the Sharpe Ratio.
2. **Adjusting RSI thresholds (`rsi_oversold`: 40, `rsi_overbought`: 80)**: In a strong bull market, RSI will naturally stay in the upper portion of its range. Raising the `rsi_overbought` threshold to 80 makes short-selling signals extremely rare, preventing disastrous entries against the primary trend. Concurrently, raising the `rsi_oversold` level to 40 acknowledges that in an uptrend, significant pullbacks are rare, and buying a less severe dip is a more viable strategy. This asymmetry better adapts the strategy to the bullish market conditions.
3. **Lengthening `rsi_length` to 18**: A longer RSI period smooths the indicator, reducing whipsaws and confirming that a price level is genuinely extended before generating a signal. This complements the wider Bollinger Bands to focus on higher-conviction setups.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 30,
  "bb_std": 3.0,
  "rsi_length": 18,
  "rsi_oversold": 40,
  "rsi_overbought": 80
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Low-to-normal volatility, range-bound markets
- Markets with no clear directional trend (sideways consolidation)
- Mean-reverting currency pairs or assets

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk is a fundamental strategy-market mismatch. The current backtest applies a mean-reversion strategy to a strongly bullish, trending market. This is evidenced by the extremely poor Sharpe Ratio (-2.56) despite a high Win Rate (60.71%). This pattern is characteristic of strategies that generate many small wins but suffer infrequent, catastrophic losses when fighting a strong trend (e.g., shorting into a bull market). The low total trade count (56) also introduces a risk of overfitting and suggests the results may not be statistically significant. The suggested conservative parameters may further reduce trade frequency, increasing this risk.
