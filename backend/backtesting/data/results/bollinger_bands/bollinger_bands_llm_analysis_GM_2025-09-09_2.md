## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 113.15%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -0.59
- **Max Drawdown**: 2.87%
- **Win Rate**: 61.54%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.31
- **Total Trades**: 65

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy's negative Sharpe ratio is the primary concern. To address this, we need to reduce the frequency of losing trades and/or increase the size of winning trades.  Adjusting the Bollinger Band standard deviation ('bb_std') upwards (from 1.775 to 2.0) increases the sensitivity to price movements; it increases the number of trades (by widening the band). However, this can reduce the overall profitability if done without changing other parameters. By shortening the RSI period ('rsi_length') from 18 to 14 and shifting the overbought/oversold thresholds, we aim to increase responsiveness to short-term momentum changes, thereby generating more profitable trades in trending markets.  Reducing the 'rsi_oversold' value to 25 and increasing 'rsi_overbought' to 75 makes the strategy more sensitive to short-term price reversals, potentially improving the win rate and profit factor. Shortening 'bb_length' from 26 to 20 will increase the sensitivity of the Bollinger Bands to recent price action. This should improve the responsiveness in higher volatility markets. We will only slightly increase the frequency of trades, but the overall winrate should be more significant, leading to a higher sharpe ratio. Finally, the market condition analysis indicates a bullish trend and normal volatility, where this strategy can thrive.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- High volatility trending markets
- Bullish trending markets with moderate volatility

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy shows a negative Sharpe ratio, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.  The high total return is misleading given the negative Sharpe. The low maximum drawdown is positive, but the Profit Factor of 1.31 is relatively low, suggesting potential for improvement in trade selection. The small number of trades (65) may also indicate overfitting or insufficient data for robust conclusions.  Further backtesting with the suggested parameters and out-of-sample testing is crucial to validate performance.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
