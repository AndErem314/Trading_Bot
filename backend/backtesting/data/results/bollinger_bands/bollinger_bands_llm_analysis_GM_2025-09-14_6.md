### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "bb_length": 26,
  "bb_std": 1.77,
  "rsi_length": 18,
  "rsi_oversold": 32,
  "rsi_overbought": 69
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy's performance is severely hampered by parameters that are too sensitive for the observed bullish market conditions. A `bb_std` of 1.77 and non-extreme RSI levels generate frequent, low-quality signals that attempt to counter a strong underlying trend, resulting in a negative risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio -0.59).

The optimization focuses on increasing signal quality over signal quantity:
1.  **Increasing `bb_std` to 2.5:** This is the most critical change. Widening the bands requires a more significant price move to generate a signal, effectively filtering out market noise and preventing premature entries against the trend. This will directly target the poor risk-adjusted returns.
2.  **Adjusting `bb_length` to 20 and `rsi_length` to 14:** These are more standard lookback periods that often provide a better balance between responsiveness and smoothness.
3.  **Making RSI thresholds more extreme (`25`/`75`):** This change acts as a powerful secondary filter. By waiting for a more deeply oversold or overbought condition, we gain higher confirmation that a price extension is exhausted and is more likely to revert. The higher `rsi_overbought` of 75 is particularly important for avoiding short positions in a strong bull market.

Collectively, these changes will force the strategy to be more patient and selective, aiming for fewer but higher-probability trades. This should lead to a significant improvement in the Sharpe Ratio and Profit Factor, while also reducing the Max Drawdown by avoiding a 'death by a thousand cuts' scenario in a trending market.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound or consolidating markets
- High volatility, mean-reverting markets
- Markets with no strong, sustained directional trend

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk with the current strategy is its poor performance in trending markets. As a mean-reversion system, it is designed to sell strength and buy weakness, which leads to repeated losses when a strong trend persists, as evidenced by the negative Sharpe Ratio in the current bullish market. The suggested parameter adjustments aim to mitigate this by making the entry signals far more selective, which will likely reduce the total number of trades. A lower trade count can increase the risk of statistical variance, meaning the results could be due to a few lucky trades. Therefore, it is critical to validate these new parameters over a longer time horizon and on out-of-sample data to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.
