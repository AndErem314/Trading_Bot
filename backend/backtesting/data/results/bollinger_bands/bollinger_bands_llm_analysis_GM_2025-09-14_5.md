### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "bb_length": 26,
  "bb_std": 1.7751521847992457,
  "rsi_length": 18,
  "rsi_oversold": 32,
  "rsi_overbought": 69
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance indicates a classic mean-reversion pitfall: fighting a strong trend. The strategy is winning often but losing big. The optimization aims to improve the quality of trade signals and increase the profit per trade, thereby boosting the Sharpe Ratio and Profit Factor.

1.  **Widening Bollinger Bands (`bb_std`: 1.775 -> 2.5):** This is the most critical change. The current narrow bands are generating signals on minor, insignificant pullbacks. Widening the bands to 2.5 standard deviations requires a much more statistically significant price extension to trigger a trade. This will filter out market noise, reduce the number of low-quality trades against the trend, and improve the probability of a meaningful price reversion.

2.  **Shortening Lookback Periods (`bb_length`: 26 -> 20, `rsi_length`: 18 -> 14):** In a choppy but trending market, making the indicators more responsive to recent price action is beneficial. A shorter `bb_length` adapts the bands more quickly to recent volatility, while a standard 14-period RSI provides a more timely confirmation of momentum exhaustion.

3.  **Stricter RSI Thresholds (`rsi_oversold`: 32 -> 25, `rsi_overbought`: 69 -> 75):** The current RSI filters are too lenient for a trending market. By requiring a deeper oversold condition (25) for buys and a more extreme overbought condition (75) for sells, we add a stronger confirmation layer. This ensures the strategy only acts on significant pullbacks or blow-off tops, which have a higher chance of reverting, rather than on minor dips within the trend.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound / sideways markets
- High-volatility, non-trending environments
- Markets exhibiting clear mean-reverting characteristics

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk for this mean-reversion strategy is **trend risk**. The provided market data indicates a 'bullish' trend, which is fundamentally at odds with the strategy's logic. The current negative Sharpe Ratio (-0.59) despite a high Win Rate (61.54%) confirms that the strategy is likely capturing small profits on minor pullbacks but suffering large losses when the primary trend resumes. This results in a poor risk/reward profile. A secondary risk is a sudden regime shift to a low-volatility trending market, where the price can 'walk the band' for extended periods, generating no signals or repeated losing trades. The suggested parameters aim to mitigate this by demanding more significant price deviations for trade entry, but the fundamental risk of fighting a strong trend remains.
