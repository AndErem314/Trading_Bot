### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance metrics (negative Sharpe, low Profit Factor despite a 60% Win Rate) strongly suggest the strategy is generating too many low-quality signals. It's winning small but not enough to cover the losses, which is typical in a choppy market where standard parameters are too sensitive. My recommendations are designed to address this by increasing signal selectivity:

1.  **Widen the Bollinger Bands (`bb_length`: 25, `bb_std`: 2.5):** The standard 20-period, 2.0-std deviation bands are being touched too frequently in this 'normal' volatility environment. Increasing the length to 25 makes the moving average baseline more stable, while increasing the standard deviation to 2.5 requires a more significant price deviation to trigger a signal. This will filter out market noise and focus only on more statistically significant price extensions, which have a higher probability of reverting to the mean.

2.  **Increase RSI Selectivity (`rsi_length`: 12, `rsi_oversold`: 25, `rsi_overbought`: 75):** The standard 14-period RSI with 30/70 thresholds is not providing sufficient confirmation. Lowering the `rsi_length` to 12 makes it slightly more responsive to recent price action. More importantly, making the thresholds more extreme (25 for oversold, 75 for overbought) ensures that we only enter a trade when momentum is significantly exhausted, providing stronger confirmation for the Bollinger Band signal. This combination aims to reduce the number of trades while significantly increasing the average profit per trade, which should directly boost the Profit Factor and, consequently, the Sharpe Ratio.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 25,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 12,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Range-bound / consolidating markets
- Markets with high short-term volatility but no consistent long-term trend
- Choppy markets with frequent price oscillations (mean-reversion)

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy's primary risk is underperformance and capital erosion through transaction costs, a 'death by a thousand cuts' scenario. Its extremely low Sharpe Ratio (-1.43) indicates it is not compensating for the risk taken. While the Max Drawdown is low, this is a byproduct of its failure to capture any significant gains. The proposed parameter changes aim to increase selectivity, which introduces a new risk: missed opportunities. By waiting for more extreme conditions, the strategy will trade less frequently and may miss smaller, profitable moves. There is also a risk of over-fitting; these new parameters must be validated with out-of-sample and walk-forward testing to ensure they are robust across different market regimes and not just curve-fit to the historical data provided.
