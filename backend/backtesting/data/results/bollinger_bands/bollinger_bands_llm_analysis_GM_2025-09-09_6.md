## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 113.15%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -0.59
- **Max Drawdown**: 2.87%
- **Win Rate**: 61.54%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.31
- **Total Trades**: 65

### Optimization Recommendations

The suggested parameter adjustments aim to improve the Sharpe ratio and reduce drawdown.  

* **Reducing `bb_length` to 20:** Shortening the Bollinger Band period increases sensitivity to recent price action, potentially capturing sharper trends and quicker reversals, leading to faster exits from losing positions. This is particularly relevant given the decreasing volume trend observed in the market. 
* **Increasing `bb_std` to 2.0:** Widening the Bollinger Bands allows for more significant price deviations before generating signals. This reduces whipsaws and potentially enhances risk-adjusted returns, especially in a market with normal volatility as indicated in the market analysis.
* **Adjusting RSI parameters:** Decreasing `rsi_oversold` to 25 and increasing `rsi_overbought` to 75 makes the RSI more sensitive to potential overbought/oversold conditions, filtering out some noisy signals.  The RSI length of 14 is a common and generally effective setting. 

These changes are aimed at generating fewer, more decisive trading signals, improving the quality of trades and therefore enhancing the Sharpe Ratio while potentially reducing drawdown.  It is crucial to understand that these are just estimates, and further backtesting and validation are necessary to confirm their effectiveness.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 25,
  "rsi_overbought": 75
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- High volatility trending markets
- Strong Bullish Trends

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy, while exhibiting high total returns (113.15%), suffers from a negative Sharpe Ratio (-0.59), indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.  The low maximum drawdown (2.87%) is positive, but the negative Sharpe ratio suggests that the returns are not compensating for the risk taken. The low Profit Factor (1.31) further underscores this concern.  A negative Sharpe ratio and a profit factor below 2 raise significant risk concerns. The relatively low number of trades (65) also limits the statistical significance of the backtest results. Further testing with increased data and robustness checks is needed.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 15.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
