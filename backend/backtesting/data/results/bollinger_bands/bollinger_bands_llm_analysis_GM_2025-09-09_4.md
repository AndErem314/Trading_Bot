## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 11.60%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -2.63
- **Max Drawdown**: 0.81%
- **Win Rate**: 62.50%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.10
- **Total Trades**: 112

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters are likely not optimized for the observed market conditions. The negative Sharpe ratio highlights a need to reduce the frequency of losses and/or increase the magnitude of profits.  

* **bb_length:** Reducing `bb_length` to 20 from a potentially higher value makes the Bollinger Bands more responsive to recent price action, which could lead to quicker entry and exit points in a trending market, potentially capitalizing on sharper price movements. 
* **bb_std:** Decreasing `bb_std` to 2.0 narrows the bands, resulting in fewer signals and potentially higher quality trades.  This reduces the noise and false signals associated with wider bands.
* **rsi_length:**  A shorter `rsi_length` (14) increases responsiveness to recent price movements, aligning it better with the more reactive Bollinger Bands. 
* **rsi_oversold/overbought:** The standard values of 30 and 70 for overbought/oversold conditions provide a good balance between sensitivity and false signals, helping to refine entry and exit points in conjunction with the Bollinger Bands signals.

The combination of a shorter Bollinger Band length and a narrower standard deviation aims to improve trade selection in a trending market while reducing exposure to sideways movement. The RSI parameters further fine-tune the entry/exit to capture more of the momentum in a bullish trending market.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- High Volatility Trending Markets (bullish)
- Normal Volatility Trending Markets (bullish)

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits a negative Sharpe ratio (-2.63), indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.  The low profit factor (1.10) suggests that profits are barely exceeding losses. While the maximum drawdown is relatively low (0.81%), the negative Sharpe ratio signals a significant risk of larger future drawdowns. The win rate (62.5%) is decent, but the negative Sharpe ratio suggests that winning trades are not compensating for losing trades adequately.  The suggested parameter changes aim to improve the risk-reward profile by potentially increasing the average win size while reducing the average loss size, leading to a better Sharpe ratio.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
