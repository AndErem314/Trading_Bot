## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 11.60%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -2.63
- **Max Drawdown**: 0.81%
- **Win Rate**: 62.50%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.10
- **Total Trades**: 112

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy has a negative Sharpe ratio, primarily due to a high level of risk relative to the relatively modest returns (11.60%). The proposed changes focus on addressing this imbalance. Increasing `bb_length` to 25 from 20 will smooth the Bollinger Bands, potentially reducing whipsaws and false signals in noisy markets. Increasing `bb_std` to 2.5 allows for wider bands, capturing broader price swings whilst avoiding excessive overtrading.  Adjusting the RSI parameters slightly (`rsi_oversold` to 30, `rsi_overbought` to 70) should allow for better identification of stronger trend reversals by tightening the range of overbought/oversold conditions.  These adjustments will likely decrease the overall number of trades.  The reduction in trades, combined with a filtering of higher probability trades, will aim to improve the risk-reward profile, ultimately leading to a better Sharpe ratio.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 25,
  "bb_std": 2.5,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Low to moderate volatility trending markets
- Bullish trending markets with decreasing volume

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits a negative Sharpe ratio (-2.63), indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.  While the maximum drawdown is relatively low (0.81%), the negative Sharpe ratio suggests significant downside risk relative to the returns achieved. The low profit factor (1.10) further reinforces this concern.  The suggested parameter changes aim to improve the Sharpe ratio by potentially reducing the frequency of losing trades, while maintaining acceptable profit. However, there's inherent risk that any optimization may not translate directly to out-of-sample performance, particularly given the relatively low number of total trades (112).  Further backtesting and robust validation are critical.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
