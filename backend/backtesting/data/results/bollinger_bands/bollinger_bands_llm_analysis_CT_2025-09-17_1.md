- **Sharpe Ratio**: -0.59
- **Max Drawdown**: 2.88%
- **Win Rate**: 61.54%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.31

### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "bb_length": 26,
  "bb_std": 1.77,
  "rsi_length": 18,
  "rsi_oversold": 32,
  "rsi_overbought": 69
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

Adjusting the Bollinger Bands length to 20 and standard deviation to 2.0 allows the strategy to better capture price movements in a bullish market while avoiding excessive whipsaw trades during lower volatility. The RSI parameters have been modified to standard values (14 for length, 30 for oversold, and 70 for overbought), which are more commonly accepted and have historically performed well. This should stabilize trading signals, leading to more consistent returns and potentially improving the Sharpe ratio.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Normal volatility environments with bullish trends
- Moderate volatility with increasing volume
- Range-bound markets with periodic bullish breakouts

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy has a negative Sharpe ratio, indicating that the returns are not compensating for the risk taken. The Max Drawdown at 2.88% is relatively low, but with a focus on improving the Sharpe ratio, it is crucial to optimize parameters that help in risk management while aiming for better profitability. The suggested parameters are designed to enhance the risk-return profile of the strategy.
