## bollinger_bands Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: 11.60%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -2.63
- **Max Drawdown**: 0.81%
- **Win Rate**: 62.50%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.10
- **Total Trades**: 112

### Optimization Recommendations

The current negative Sharpe ratio indicates a problem with risk management.  The suggested parameters aim to address this: 

* **Reducing `bb_std` to 2.0:** This makes the Bollinger Bands narrower, generating fewer signals and potentially reducing whipsaw trades that contribute to the negative Sharpe ratio.  Narrower bands mean fewer trades and a greater filter on signal quality.
* **`bb_length` of 20:** This is a commonly used value and provides a balance between responsiveness to price changes and smoothing out noise.  The current parameter optimization range is already relatively small and narrow, so we are not changing it much from the default values often utilized.
* **RSI parameters:** The standard RSI parameters of 14-period length, 30 oversold, and 70 overbought provide a reasonable balance between sensitivity and preventing too many false signals. These are standard parameters considered good starting points that many traders use.

The goal is to improve the risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio) by reducing the frequency of losing trades without significantly impacting the win rate.  This is a delicate balance, and further testing and parameter tuning might be necessary, but these changes are expected to significantly improve the results on further testing with more data. This strategy may be more robust and less impacted by noise in lower-volatility markets, and thus the parameters are chosen to allow it to be more applicable in a variety of market situations.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "bb_length": 20,
  "bb_std": 2.0,
  "rsi_length": 14,
  "rsi_oversold": 30,
  "rsi_overbought": 70
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Normal volatility, bullish trending markets
- Low to moderate volatility, sideways trending markets with defined support and resistance

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits a negative Sharpe ratio, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns.  The low maximum drawdown is positive, suggesting the strategy is relatively resilient to sharp market reversals. However, the low profit factor and negative Sharpe ratio point towards a need for significant improvement.  The low number of trades (112) warrants caution in interpreting the results; more data is always preferable. Over-optimization on this limited dataset is a real concern. Backtest results should always be treated with skepticism and validated with out-of-sample data.  It's crucial to acknowledge that past performance is not indicative of future results.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
