## parabolic_sar Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: -9973.26%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: -5.41
- **Max Drawdown**: 99.76%
- **Win Rate**: 30.78%
- **Profit Factor**: 0.60
- **Total Trades**: 1904

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance metrics (-5.41 Sharpe, 99.76% drawdown) strongly suggest the Parabolic SAR is 'over-sensitive' to price action, causing it to generate frequent, premature stop-and-reverse signals in a market that, while directionally bullish, is extremely inconsistent. The optimization goal is to make the indicator less responsive to minor price fluctuations, thereby filtering out market noise and catching more substantial trend movements.

1.  **Lowering `start` to 0.01 and `increment` to 0.01:** These are the lowest values in the optimization range. Decreasing the initial and incremental acceleration factors (AF) will make the SAR curve trail the price from a greater distance and accelerate more slowly. This gives the price more room to fluctuate during pullbacks without triggering a premature reversal, aiming to reduce the number of losing trades and increase the profit factor.

2.  **Lowering `maximum` to 0.15:** Capping the acceleration factor at a lower level prevents the SAR from becoming too aggressive and hugging the price too tightly later in a trend. This further reduces the probability of being stopped out by minor corrections within a larger, established trend.

Collectively, these changes will decrease the total number of trades, aiming to increase the Win Rate and Profit Factor by focusing only on more persistent, less noisy price moves. This should directly address the severe drawdown and negative Sharpe ratio.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "start": 0.01,
  "increment": 0.01,
  "maximum": 0.15
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, consistent trending markets (either bullish or bearish)
- Markets with low-to-normal volatility and clear directional momentum
- Avoid choppy, range-bound, or low trend-consistency markets

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy's performance is catastrophic, indicating a fundamental mismatch between the strategy's logic and the market's behavior. The primary risk, evidenced by the -83.5 consistency score, is 'whipsaw' in a choppy market. As a trend-following system that is always in the market, it is exceptionally vulnerable to frequent reversals, which lead to a high number of losing trades and a severe drawdown. The suggested parameter adjustments aim to mitigate this by reducing sensitivity, but they will not eliminate the inherent risk of using this strategy during periods of consolidation or inconsistent trends. Even with optimization, the strategy may still underperform significantly in unfavorable market regimes. A trend-filtering mechanism is strongly advised to be used in conjunction with this strategy to pause trading during such periods.
