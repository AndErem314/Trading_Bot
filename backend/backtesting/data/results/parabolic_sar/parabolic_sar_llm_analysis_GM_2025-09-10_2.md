### Optimal Market Conditions
- "risk_assessment": "The current backtest results demonstrate catastrophic performance.  A -9973.26% total return, -5.41 Sharpe ratio, and 99.76% maximum drawdown indicate significant flaws in the strategy or its parameterization. The low profit factor (0.60) and win rate (30.78%) further confirm this.  The strategy is likely prone to overfitting and susceptible to whipsaws, especially given the current parameters are completely absent.  Any optimization should prioritize risk reduction and a significantly improved Sharpe Ratio before targeting profit maximization. We should focus on identifying parameters that lead to a positive Sharpe Ratio even if the absolute returns are somewhat lower. The extremely high price range and decreasing volume suggest significant market uncertainty. The analysis needs to focus on surviving rather than gaining significant returns under the conditions of the backtest.",
- "Add a stop-loss mechanism independent of the Parabolic SAR to limit potential losses in extreme market conditions.",
- "Re-evaluate the choice of the Parabolic SAR in light of the poor performance, perhaps considering alternative strategies that may better suit the observed market conditions."
