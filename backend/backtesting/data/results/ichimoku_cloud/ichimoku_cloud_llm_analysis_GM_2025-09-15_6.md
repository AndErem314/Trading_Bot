### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance metrics point to a classic problem for trend-following systems: poor performance in choppy markets. The market analysis confirms this with a very low trend consistency score (-83.53). The strategy is too sensitive to short-term price fluctuations, leading to frequent, small losses that culminate in a large drawdown. The optimization goal is to make the system less reactive and more focused on the longer-term trend.

1.  **Increasing `kijun_period` (22 -> 30):** This is the most critical change. The Kijun-sen (baseline) is a key determinant of the medium-term trend. Lengthening its period from 22 to the maximum of its range (30) will smooth it out significantly. This will create a more stable support/resistance level, preventing the strategy from being stopped out by minor corrections within a larger trend.

2.  **Increasing `senkou_b_period` (56 -> 60):** The Senkou Span B is the slowest component and forms the foundation of the Kumo (cloud). Increasing its period creates a thicker, more robust cloud. A thicker cloud represents a stronger area of equilibrium, providing better support during pullbacks and making it harder for price to generate a false trend-reversal signal.

3.  **Increasing `tenkan_period` (11 -> 12) and `displacement` (26 -> 28):** These are secondary adjustments that align with the primary goal. A slightly longer Tenkan-sen reduces noise on the fastest signal line, while a longer displacement projects the cloud further into the future, providing a clearer long-term outlook. 

Collectively, these changes will result in fewer trades, but each trade will be based on a more confirmed, longer-term trend signal. This should increase the average profit per trade and significantly reduce the frequency of losing trades caused by market choppiness, directly targeting the high drawdown and low Sharpe ratio.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 12,
  "kijun_period": 30,
  "senkou_b_period": 60,
  "displacement": 28
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, consistent trending markets (bullish or bearish).
- Periods of sustained, above-average volatility.
- Markets with clear breakouts from consolidation ranges.

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk in the current strategy is the exceptionally high maximum drawdown of 54.02%. This level of drawdown is unacceptable for most portfolios as it indicates a high risk of ruin. The root cause appears to be the strategy's susceptibility to 'whipsaws' in a market characterized by a strong but highly inconsistent trend. The low win rate (34.25%) combined with this drawdown suggests the strategy enters trades prematurely or exits on minor pullbacks that do not signify a true trend reversal. The proposed parameter adjustments aim to mitigate this by reducing signal frequency and filtering out market noise. However, this may introduce lag, potentially causing later entries into established trends and a slight reduction in total return. The key trade-off is sacrificing some return potential for a significant and necessary improvement in risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown).
