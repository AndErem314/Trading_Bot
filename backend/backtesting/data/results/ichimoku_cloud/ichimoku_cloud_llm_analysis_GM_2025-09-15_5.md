### Current Parameters Used

  "kijun_period": 26,
  "senkou_b_period": 52,
  "displacement": 26
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The core issue with the current performance is the strategy's over-sensitivity to price noise within a larger, but inconsistent, trend. The high drawdown and low Sharpe ratio are direct results of being whipsawed. The proposed optimization 'slows down' the Ichimoku indicator to filter out this noise and focus on more significant, established trends.

1.  **Increasing `tenkan_period` (9 to 11) and `kijun_period` (26 to 28):** This makes the Tenkan-sen/Kijun-sen crossover signals less frequent but more reliable. It requires a more sustained price move to generate a signal, reducing entries on minor pullbacks or consolidations that quickly reverse.

2.  **Increasing `senkou_b_period` (52 to 56):** This creates a wider, more stable Kumo (cloud). A more stable cloud acts as a better filter for the overall trend and provides more robust support/resistance levels. This should help the strategy stay in trades during minor corrections and avoid premature exits.

3.  **Adjusting `displacement` (26 to 28):** This aligns the projected Kumo with the new `kijun_period`, maintaining the internal logic of the Ichimoku system. 

Collectively, these changes should lead to fewer, but higher-quality, trades. This will likely decrease the total number of trades and may slightly lower the total return, but it is expected to significantly reduce the maximum drawdown and improve the Sharpe Ratio by increasing the consistency of profits.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 11,
  "kijun_period": 28,
  "senkou_b_period": 56,
  "displacement": 28
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, consistent trending markets (bullish or bearish)
- Markets with normal to high volatility
- Trends supported by stable or increasing volume

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy's risk profile is extremely poor, highlighted by a maximum drawdown of 56.56% and a Sharpe Ratio of only 0.47. This indicates that the returns do not justify the immense risk taken. The Profit Factor of 1.20 suggests a very thin edge that could easily be eroded by transaction costs or slight changes in market behavior. The low win rate combined with the high drawdown points to the strategy holding onto losing trades for too long during trend reversals or consolidations. The primary risk is 'whipsaw' action in non-trending or inconsistently trending markets, which the market conditions analysis confirms was a significant issue (trend consistency: -83.53). The proposed parameter changes aim to mitigate this, but any optimization carries the risk of curve-fitting, which must be validated with out-of-sample data.
