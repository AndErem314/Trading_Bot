### Optimization Recommendations

The core issue is the strategy's over-sensitivity to price fluctuations within a strong but inconsistent trend. The optimization goal is to 'slow down' the system to focus on the primary trend and filter out market noise, thereby improving risk-adjusted returns.

1.  **Increasing `tenkan_period` (to 11) and `kijun_period` (to 28):** Lengthening the periods for the conversion and base lines makes them less reactive to short-term price swings. This will result in fewer, but higher-quality, trading signals. Crossovers will require more sustained momentum, which should help filter out whipsaws in choppy conditions, directly improving the Win Rate and Profit Factor.

2.  **Increasing `senkou_b_period` (to 56):** This is the most critical change for drawdown reduction. A longer lookback period for Senkou Span B creates a wider and more robust Kumo (cloud). A wider cloud acts as a stronger dynamic support/resistance zone. This will help the strategy maintain its position during deep pullbacks that might have stopped out the previous configuration, allowing it to ride the primary trend more effectively and reducing the likelihood of catastrophic drawdowns.

3.  **Adjusting `displacement` (to 28):** Aligning the displacement period with the new `kijun_period` maintains the internal logic and symmetry of the Ichimoku system, ensuring the Chikou Span (lagging span) provides a relevant confirmation signal based on the updated trend definition.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 11,
  "kijun_period": 28,
  "senkou_b_period": 56,
  "displacement": 28
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strongly trending markets (both bullish and bearish)
- Markets with high directional conviction and low price choppiness
- High volatility environments where volatility is directional, not consolidative

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits classic signs of a high-risk, unfiltered trend-following system. The primary risk is the extremely high Maximum Drawdown of 56.56%, which is unacceptable for most risk management frameworks. This indicates the strategy holds onto positions through severe and prolonged pullbacks. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.47 confirms that the impressive Total Return is not justified by the amount of risk taken; returns are highly volatile. The low Profit Factor of 1.20 suggests that the edge is very slim, with losing trades nearly wiping out the gains from winners. Furthermore, the market analysis points to a decreasing volume trend, which could signal a weakening of the current bull trend, posing a significant forward-looking risk to any trend-following strategy.
