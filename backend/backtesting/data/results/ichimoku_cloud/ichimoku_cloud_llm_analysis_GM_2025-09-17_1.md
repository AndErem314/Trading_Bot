### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance issues stem from a mismatch between the parameter settings and the market's choppy nature. The strategy is being whipsawed by pullbacks within the larger bullish trend. My recommendation aims to create a more robust filtering mechanism to improve signal quality and reduce drawdown.

1.  **Senkou B Period (60):** We will keep this at the maximum value in the range. A longer `senkou_b_period` creates a more stable, slower-moving cloud (Kumo). This acts as a powerful macro trend filter, helping the strategy to ignore the significant, short-term pullbacks that are causing the large drawdowns. Only signals that align with the direction of this stable cloud will be considered, effectively filtering out noise.

2.  **Tenkan (9) & Kijun (26) Periods:** By reverting these to shorter, more standard values, we make the entry trigger (Tenkan/Kijun cross) more responsive. This seems counterintuitive, but it works in concert with the slow Senkou B. The slow cloud confirms the *regime*, and the faster Tenkan/Kijun provides a more timely *entry signal* once the price action aligns with that regime. This combination seeks to enter strong moves earlier and exit losing trades quicker, improving the Profit Factor.

3.  **Displacement (26):** Aligning the displacement with the Kijun period is a standard practice that maintains the traditional timing relationship of the Ichimoku system.

This new configuration is designed to be more selective, prioritizing high-quality trends and avoiding trades during periods of low trend consistency. The expected outcome is a reduction in the total number of trades, a higher win rate and profit factor, a significant reduction in Max Drawdown, and consequently, a much-improved Sharpe Ratio.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 9,
  "kijun_period": 26,
  "senkou_b_period": 60,
  "displacement": 26
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, high-consistency trending markets (bullish or bearish).
- Markets with sustained directional momentum and low-to-normal volatility.
- Post-consolidation breakouts where a new, clear trend is established.

### Risk Assessment
The strategy's primary risk is its extremely high Maximum Drawdown of 57.07%. This level of capital erosion is unacceptable and indicates the system is highly vulnerable to choppy markets and trend reversals, which the market analysis confirms ('consistency': -83.53). The sub-1.0 Sharpe Ratio (0.74) further demonstrates that returns are not commensurate with the risk taken. The low win rate (36.50%) combined with a modest Profit Factor (1.41) suggests the strategy suffers from numerous false signals ('whipsaws'), which slowly erode capital between winning trades. The decreasing volume trend also signals potential trend exhaustion, increasing the risk of failed signals. The current parameter set is poorly adapted to the observed market character.
