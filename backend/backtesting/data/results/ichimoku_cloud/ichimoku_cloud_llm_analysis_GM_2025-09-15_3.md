}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The core issue with the current performance is an oversensitivity to market noise and pullbacks, which is punished in a market with low trend consistency. The optimization goal is to make the strategy less reactive and more focused on the primary, long-term trend, thereby filtering out this noise. 

1.  **Lengthening Kijun and Senkou B Periods (`kijun_period`: 30, `senkou_b_period`: 60):** By increasing the lookback periods for the baseline (Kijun-sen) and the cloud's foundation (Senkou Span B), we make these key support/resistance levels more robust. A slower, wider cloud is less likely to be penetrated by short-term price swings, preventing premature exits from profitable trends and reducing false entries during consolidations. This is the most direct way to address the high drawdown.

2.  **Slowing the Tenkan Period (`tenkan_period`: 12):** Increasing the period of the fastest-moving line (Tenkan-sen) reduces the number of crossover signals, filtering out the lowest-quality, most noise-driven entry points. This should improve the Win Rate and Profit Factor over time.

3.  **Aligning Displacement (`displacement`: 30):** The displacement parameter projects the cloud into the future. Aligning it with the new, longer `kijun_period` of 30 maintains the internal logic and timing of the Ichimoku system.

Collectively, these changes aim to shift the strategy from a nimble but fragile system to a more robust, long-term trend-following model. This should result in fewer trades, but each trade will be based on a more significant, confirmed trend, leading to a better Sharpe Ratio and a significantly lower Max Drawdown.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 12,
  "kijun_period": 30,
  "senkou_b_period": 60,
  "displacement": 30
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strongly trending markets with high consistency (sustained trends without sharp reversals).
- Moderate to high volatility environments where trends have room to develop.
- Markets where volume is confirming the trend direction (e.g., increasing volume in a bullish trend).

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk of the current strategy is its exceptionally high Maximum Drawdown of 53.05%. This level of risk is unacceptable for most investment mandates and indicates the strategy is highly vulnerable to trend reversals or periods of high volatility without clear direction. The market analysis points to a low 'trend consistency' (-83.53), which explains why a trend-following strategy is suffering such deep pullbacks. The modest Profit Factor of 1.35 is not sufficient to compensate for the low Win Rate (31.85%), meaning the strategy relies on a few large wins to offset many small losses, a characteristic that can lead to significant psychological pressure and risk of ruin. The decreasing volume trend is another warning sign, suggesting the underlying bullish trend may be losing momentum, which would further degrade the performance of this strategy.
