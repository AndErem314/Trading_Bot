### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 9,
  "kijun_period": 30,
  "senkou_b_period": 60,
  "displacement": 30
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters are too slow and mismatched, making the strategy susceptible to the identified market choppiness. The goal of the suggested optimization is to create a more coherent and robust system that filters short-term noise while remaining responsive to the underlying trend.

1.  **Tenkan/Kijun Relationship**: We increase `tenkan_period` from 9 to 10 to slightly smooth the fastest-moving component, reducing false signals from minor price spikes. We simultaneously decrease `kijun_period` from 30 to the standard 26. This makes the medium-term trend line more responsive, allowing for quicker confirmation of valid trend shifts while the smoother Tenkan acts as a better filter.

2.  **Cloud Structure & Logic**: We adjust `senkou_b_period` and `displacement` to their standard values (52 and 26, respectively). The current `senkou_b_period` of 60 creates an overly lagging, insensitive cloud. A period of 52 provides a better balance, offering robust support/resistance filtering without being excessively late to major trend changes. Aligning the `displacement` with the `kijun_period` (both at 26) restores the internal logical harmony of the Ichimoku system, ensuring the 'future' cloud is a relevant projection of the current medium-term momentum.

This new parameter set is designed to improve the quality of signals, increase the Profit Factor by letting winners run further in confirmed trends, and most importantly, reduce the catastrophic drawdowns by avoiding premature entries in inconsistent market phases.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 10,
  "kijun_period": 26,
  "senkou_b_period": 52,
  "displacement": 26
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, consistent trending markets (bullish or bearish)
- Markets with sustained periods of low-to-normal volatility
- Breakout scenarios after a prolonged consolidation phase

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk of the current strategy is its extreme vulnerability to trend inconsistency, leading to an unacceptable Maximum Drawdown of 58.26%. The low Sharpe Ratio of 0.55 and Profit Factor of 1.25 indicate that the strategy is not being adequately compensated for the high level of risk it undertakes. The core issue is 'whipsaw' action in a market that is broadly trending but highly volatile and inconsistent day-to-day. This suggests the strategy is entering on perceived trend signals but is being stopped out by sharp, short-term counter-movements. Without significant changes to its parameters and risk management, the strategy faces a high risk of capital depletion.
