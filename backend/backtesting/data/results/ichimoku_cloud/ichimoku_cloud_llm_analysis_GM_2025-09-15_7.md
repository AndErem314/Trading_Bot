### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 12,
  "kijun_period": 30,
  "senkou_b_period": 60,
  "displacement": 28
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters (12, 30, 60) are too slow and lagging for the observed market conditions, which feature an erratic, low-consistency trend. The goal of this optimization is to make the strategy more agile and responsive to price changes, with the primary objective of cutting losses faster to reduce the max drawdown.

1.  **Reducing `kijun_period` (30 -> 22) and `tenkan_period` (12 -> 9):** This is the most critical change. A shorter Kijun-sen acts as a more dynamic, tighter trailing stop for long positions. It will track the price more closely, forcing an exit earlier during a significant pullback and directly addressing the root cause of the large drawdown. The faster Tenkan-sen will make the entry cross more responsive.

2.  **Reducing `senkou_b_period` (60 -> 48):** Shortening the longest-term component makes the Kumo (cloud) itself more reactive to recent price action. A more dynamic cloud provides more relevant and timely support/resistance levels, which can improve trade filtering and validation.

3.  **Adjusting `displacement` (28 -> 24):** This change aligns the projected cloud with the shorter Kijun period, maintaining the internal timing harmony of the Ichimoku system.

By making the system faster, we aim to preserve capital during adverse moves, which will significantly improve the risk-adjusted return profile (Sharpe Ratio) and make the strategy more robust.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "tenkan_period": 9,
  "kijun_period": 22,
  "senkou_b_period": 48,
  "displacement": 24
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, consistent trending markets (bullish or bearish)
- Markets with normal to high volatility that fuels sustained trends

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk of the current strategy is its exceptionally high Maximum Drawdown of 57.07%. This level of risk is unacceptable for most portfolios as it indicates the strategy holds onto losing positions for too long during trend pullbacks or reversals. The market analysis confirms this, showing a 'bullish' trend but with very poor 'consistency' (-83.53), which explains the deep pullbacks. The strategy in its current form is highly vulnerable to whipsaws and trend exhaustion, especially with a decreasing volume profile which signals a potential weakening of market conviction. While the Profit Factor is positive, the low Sharpe Ratio (0.74) confirms that the returns do not justify the immense risk taken. The proposed parameter changes aim to mitigate this drawdown risk, but may increase the frequency of smaller losses in sideways markets.
