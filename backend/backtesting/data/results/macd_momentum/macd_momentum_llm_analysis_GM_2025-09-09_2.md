## macd_momentum Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: -240.45%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.00
- **Max Drawdown**: 42.09%
- **Win Rate**: 32.48%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.04
- **Total Trades**: 117

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters are completely undefined, leading to the extremely poor results. The suggested parameters are based on commonly used and relatively robust settings for MACD and momentum indicators.  A 12/26/9 MACD configuration is a popular and well-tested starting point.  Matching the momentum and ATR periods (14) is common practice for aligning risk management and trend identification. The volume threshold of 1.5 is a moderate value that filters out low-volume trades potentially associated with increased noise and slippage. The proposed changes aim to enhance the signal quality by filtering out more false signals and creating more consistency in profitable trades. This will simultaneously reduce drawdown and improve the Sharpe ratio.  The proposed changes will require more robust testing with different historical data, which may further require some adjustments.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 12,
  "macd_slow": 26,
  "macd_signal": 9,
  "momentum_period": 14,
  "atr_period": 14,
  "volume_threshold": 1.5
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Trending markets (both bullish and bearish)
- Markets with moderate volatility

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits extremely poor performance, indicated by a -240.45% total return and a Sharpe ratio of 0.00.  The high maximum drawdown (42.09%) suggests significant risk. The profit factor marginally above 1 suggests that wins are barely compensating for losses. The low win rate (32.48%) highlights the ineffectiveness of the current parameter set.  The proposed optimization focuses on improving the Sharpe ratio, reducing drawdown, and increasing the win rate.  However, even with optimization, significant risk remains inherent to this strategy and a larger sample size is critical to validate performance.  Consider adding position sizing rules based on risk tolerance and market conditions to control risk. 

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 25.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
