### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 12,
  "macd_slow": 30,
  "macd_signal": 11,
  "momentum_period": 20,
  "atr_period": 20,
  "volume_threshold": 2.0
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy's abysmal performance is a direct result of a parameter mismatch with the observed market conditions. The market was characterized by a bullish but highly inconsistent (choppy) trend and decreasing volume. The original slow parameters (e.g., `macd_slow: 30`) are designed for smooth, long-lasting trends and were therefore constantly whipsawed.

The proposed optimization aims to transform the strategy into a more nimble system capable of capturing shorter-term momentum bursts:
1.  **Increased Responsiveness (MACD):** By reducing all MACD periods (`macd_fast: 10`, `macd_slow: 22`, `macd_signal: 8`), we significantly decrease lag. This allows the strategy to enter and exit trades more quickly, which is critical for navigating a choppy market and reducing the time exposed to potential reversals.
2.  **Shorter Timeframe Alignment (Momentum & ATR):** Shortening the `momentum_period` to 14 aligns the confirmation indicator with the faster MACD signals. Similarly, a shorter `atr_period` of 14 makes the risk management (presumably for stop-loss or take-profit levels) more reactive to recent volatility, helping to cut losses faster during unfavorable moves, which is key to reducing the max drawdown.
3.  **Adaptive Entry Filter (Volume):** The `volume_threshold` of 2.0 is excessively restrictive in a market with decreasing average volume. This likely led to missed entries or, worse, entries only at the peak of unsustainable volume spikes (blow-off tops). Lowering the threshold to 1.5 allows the strategy to enter on more reasonable volume confirmations, potentially earlier in a move before it exhausts itself.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 10,
  "macd_slow": 22,
  "macd_signal": 8,
  "momentum_period": 14,
  "atr_period": 14,
  "volume_threshold": 1.5
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- High-conviction, trending markets with rising volume.
- Moderately volatile markets with clear, short-to-medium term directional swings.
- Markets where trend consistency is high and whipsaws are infrequent.

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk for this strategy is whipsaw action in non-trending or choppy markets, which the historical data suggests was the primary cause of failure. The current parameters are too slow, leading to late entries and exits. The suggested, more sensitive parameters aim to mitigate this but introduce a new risk: increased sensitivity to short-term noise and potential for more frequent, smaller losing trades. Furthermore, the strategy is being optimized on past data; there is a significant risk of overfitting. If market conditions shift to a low-volatility, range-bound environment, even the optimized parameters are likely to underperform. Trading a momentum-based strategy in a market with a systemically decreasing volume trend is inherently risky, as it signals fading conviction and increases the probability of failed breakouts.
