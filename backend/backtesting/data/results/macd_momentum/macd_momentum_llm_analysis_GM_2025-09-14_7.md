### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance indicates a fundamental mismatch between the strategy's parameters and the prevailing market conditions. The market is described as bullish but with extremely low trend consistency (-83.53), which is a classic whipsaw environment for a slow, trend-following strategy. The current parameters (`macd_slow: 30`, `macd_signal: 11`) are too slow, causing late entries and exits, which explains the poor Profit Factor (0.68) and high Max Drawdown (36.45%).

The suggested optimization aims to make the strategy more nimble and reactive:
1.  **Faster MACD & Momentum (`macd_slow: 22`, `macd_signal: 7`, `momentum_period: 14`):** By significantly reducing the lookback periods, the strategy can identify and react to short-term shifts in momentum more quickly. The goal is to capture smaller, more frequent price swings characteristic of an inconsistent trend, rather than waiting for a long-term trend that fails to materialize.
2.  **Tighter Risk Management (`atr_period: 12`):** Shortening the ATR period makes the stop-loss mechanism more responsive to recent volatility. This is a crucial adjustment designed to cut losing trades faster, directly addressing the high Max Drawdown and aiming to improve the Profit Factor by reducing the average loss size.
3.  **Adjusted Volume Filter (`volume_threshold: 1.6`):** Given the decreasing volume trend, the current `2.0` threshold may be too restrictive. Lowering it slightly to `1.6` allows the faster signal configuration to engage with more potential trades that show a reasonable level of market participation, without abandoning the volume confirmation principle entirely.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 10,
  "macd_slow": 22,
  "macd_signal": 7,
  "momentum_period": 14,
  "atr_period": 12,
  "volume_threshold": 1.6
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Consistently trending markets (either bullish or bearish)
- Periods of high momentum breakouts following consolidation
- Markets with increasing volume confirming the price trend

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk is overfitting the parameters to the specific historical data used in this backtest. The suggested changes, which make the strategy faster and more reactive, could increase susceptibility to 'whipsaws' in non-trending, choppy markets, potentially leading to a higher number of small losing trades and increased transaction costs. Furthermore, there is a regime change risk; these more aggressive parameters may cause premature exits if the market shifts from its current inconsistent state to a strong, sustained trend, thereby capping potential profits. The strategy's performance is highly dependent on the market's trend consistency, which was identified as a major weakness in the current backtest.
