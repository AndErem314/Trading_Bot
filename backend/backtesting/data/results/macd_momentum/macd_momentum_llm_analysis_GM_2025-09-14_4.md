### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 12,
  "macd_slow": 26,
  "macd_signal": 9,
  "momentum_period": 14,
  "atr_period": 14,
  "volume_threshold": 1.4
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters are too sensitive for the observed market conditions, which are defined by a strong but highly inconsistent trend. This inconsistency leads to frequent false signals and whipsaws, explaining the low win rate and high drawdown.

The suggested parameter adjustments are designed to make the strategy less reactive to market noise and more focused on capturing sustained, high-conviction moves:

1.  **Slowing the MACD and Momentum Indicators:** By increasing the lookback periods for `macd_fast` (12 to 14), `macd_slow` (26 to 28), `macd_signal` (9 to 10), and `momentum_period` (14 to 18), we aim to filter out short-term noise. The indicators will only generate signals on more established, durable trends, which should significantly reduce entries on false breakouts.

2.  **Increasing the Volume Threshold:** The market exhibits a decreasing volume trend, signifying a lack of conviction. Raising the `volume_threshold` from 1.4 to 1.8 acts as a robust confirmation filter. This ensures that the strategy only enters trades that are backed by a genuine surge in market participation, dramatically increasing the probability of follow-through and improving the quality of each signal.

3.  **Smoothing the Volatility Measure:** Increasing the `atr_period` from 14 to 18 provides a more stable volatility reading. If ATR is used for setting stop-losses, this will result in stop levels that are less influenced by single-bar anomalies, giving trades more room to breathe and survive the market's choppiness without being stopped out prematurely. This directly targets the reduction of the maximum drawdown.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 14,
  "macd_slow": 28,
  "macd_signal": 10,
  "momentum_period": 18,
  "atr_period": 18,
  "volume_threshold": 1.8
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, consistent trending markets (either bullish or bearish)
- High-volatility breakouts accompanied by significant volume spikes
- Markets where trend consistency is high, avoiding choppy or range-bound periods

### Risk Assessment
The strategy's current risk profile is extremely poor and unacceptable for deployment. The primary risk is the catastrophic maximum drawdown of 55.07%, indicating a severe failure in risk management and a high probability of ruin. This is compounded by a negative Sharpe Ratio (-0.31) and a Profit Factor below 1.0, which statistically guarantees capital erosion over time. The root cause appears to be the strategy's susceptibility to 'whipsaws' in a market characterized by an inconsistent trend. The low win rate (30.60%) suggests the strategy is frequently entering on false signals. Furthermore, the decreasing volume trend during a bullish phase is a significant bearish divergence, indicating that the underlying trend is weak and prone to sharp reversals, which this momentum-based strategy is failing to navigate.
