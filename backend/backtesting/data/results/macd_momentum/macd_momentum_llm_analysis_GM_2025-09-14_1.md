### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance metrics (-240.45% Total Return, 0.00 Sharpe) indicate a fundamental mismatch between the strategy's sensitivity and the market's character. The market is broadly bullish but highly inconsistent, causing a sensitive trend-following strategy to be repeatedly stopped out. The optimization goal is to reduce sensitivity and improve signal quality.

1.  **Slowing the MACD (14, 28, 10):** By increasing the lookback periods from the typical (12, 26, 9), we smooth both the MACD and signal lines. This requires a more sustained price move to generate a crossover, effectively filtering out the short-term noise and whipsaws that are crippling the current strategy.

2.  **Lengthening Confirmation Filters (momentum_period: 18):** A longer momentum period serves as a more robust trend confirmation filter. It ensures the strategy only acts on moves that have demonstrated persistence, rather than reacting to fleeting price spikes.

3.  **Stabilizing Stop-Losses (atr_period: 20):** The high Max Drawdown (42.09%) and low Win Rate (32.48%) suggest stops are either too tight (frequent whipsaws) or poorly placed. Using a longer ATR period provides a more stable, averaged measure of volatility. This results in wider, more resilient stop-losses that give trades enough 'breathing room' to withstand pullbacks within a larger trend, directly addressing the core issue of being shaken out of positions prematurely.

4.  **Improving Signal Conviction (volume_threshold: 1.6):** The market's decreasing volume trend signifies a lack of broad participation. By raising the volume threshold, we mandate that entries only occur during periods of significant market interest (60% above average volume). This acts as a powerful filter for higher-conviction setups, avoiding entries on low-volume drift.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 14,
  "macd_slow": 28,
  "macd_signal": 10,
  "momentum_period": 18,
  "atr_period": 20,
  "volume_threshold": 1.6
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, high-consistency trending markets (bullish or bearish)
- Periods of increasing market participation and volume
- Breakout scenarios where price movement is confirmed by high volume

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk to this strategy, even after optimization, is its performance in non-trending, choppy, or range-bound markets. The market analysis indicates a 'bullish' trend but with very low 'consistency' (-83.53), which is a classic whipsaw environment where trend-following strategies underperform. The suggested slower parameters aim to mitigate this but will not eliminate the risk entirely. This adjustment introduces lag, meaning the strategy will enter trends later and exit later, potentially missing the first part of a move and giving back more profit during a sharp reversal. Furthermore, using a longer ATR period for stops will result in larger initial risk per trade. This must be managed with disciplined position sizing to keep the risk per trade within acceptable limits (e.g., 1-2% of portfolio equity).
