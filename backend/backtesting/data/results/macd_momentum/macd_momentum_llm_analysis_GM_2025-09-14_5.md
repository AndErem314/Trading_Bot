### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 14,
  "macd_slow": 28,
  "macd_signal": 10,
  "momentum_period": 18,
  "atr_period": 18,

}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current performance metrics (Sharpe: -0.38, Win Rate: 25.97%) strongly indicate the strategy is overly sensitive and is being 'chopped up' by market noise, which aligns with the market analysis of a bullish but 'inconsistent' trend. The optimization aims to make the strategy more selective and robust.

1.  **MACD Sensitivity Reduction (`macd_fast: 12`, `macd_slow: 30`, `macd_signal: 11`):** By widening the gap between the fast and slow EMAs and increasing the signal line period, we are smoothing the indicator. This will filter out minor fluctuations and generate fewer, higher-conviction signals that align with more established trends, directly targeting the low win rate.

2.  **Trend Confirmation (`momentum_period: 20`):** Increasing the momentum lookback period to its maximum range ensures that entry signals are based on more sustained price movements, avoiding entries on short-lived spikes that quickly reverse.

3.  **Risk Management Stability (`atr_period: 20`):** A longer ATR period provides a more stable, less reactive volatility measure for calculating stop-losses. This should help prevent the strategy from being stopped out prematurely by transient volatility spikes, which is a likely contributor to the high 38.55% maximum drawdown.

4.  **Entry Conviction (`volume_threshold: 2.0`):** Elevating the volume threshold to 2.0 acts as a strict entry filter. It mandates that a trade signal must be accompanied by a significant surge in volume (2x the average). This is crucial for confirming the strength of a breakout and avoiding false signals, especially in an environment with an overall decreasing volume trend.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 12,
  "macd_slow": 30,
  "macd_signal": 11,
  "momentum_period": 20,
  "atr_period": 20,
  "volume_threshold": 2.0
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strongly trending markets with high consistency (bullish or bearish)
- High-volume breakout scenarios
- Markets with increasing volume trends confirming price action

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk for this momentum-based strategy is whipsaw action in range-bound or low-consistency trending markets, as evidenced by the current poor performance. The suggested parameters, while aimed at reducing this risk, may lead to missed opportunities in shorter-term trends. There is a significant risk of overfitting; these optimized parameters must be validated on out-of-sample data. Furthermore, increasing the volume threshold to 2.0 means the strategy will enter during periods of high activity, which can increase slippage costs not fully captured in the backtest. The strategy remains unsuitable for choppy or consolidating market regimes.
