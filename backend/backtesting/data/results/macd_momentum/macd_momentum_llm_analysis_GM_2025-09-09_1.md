## macd_momentum Strategy

### Current Performance
- **Total Return**: -240.45%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.00
- **Max Drawdown**: 42.09%
- **Win Rate**: 32.48%
- **Profit Factor**: 1.04
- **Total Trades**: 117

### Optimization Recommendations

The current parameters are undefined, resulting in catastrophic performance. The suggested parameters are based on common values used in MACD and momentum strategies.  The MACD parameters (12, 26, 9) represent a classic configuration known for its balance between sensitivity and noise. Using a 14-period momentum aligns with the MACD's sensitivity.  A 14-period ATR for position sizing offers reasonable risk management. A volume threshold of 1.5 helps filter out low-volume trades, which can be less reliable.  The optimization will focus on finding parameter combinations that reduce drawdowns. The bullish market trend identified should benefit this momentum strategy, however, the low consistency warrants caution.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 12,
  "macd_slow": 26,
  "macd_signal": 9,
  "momentum_period": 14,
  "atr_period": 14,
  "volume_threshold": 1.5
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- High volatility trending markets
- Bullish trending markets with high volume

### Risk Assessment
The current strategy exhibits extremely poor performance, indicated by a -240.45% total return and a Sharpe ratio of 0.00.  The high maximum drawdown (42.09%) suggests significant risk. The low win rate (32.48%) and profit factor slightly above 1 (1.04) confirms the strategy's unprofitability.  The suggested parameter changes aim to mitigate risk, improve consistency, and increase the Sharpe ratio. However, even with optimization, significant risk remains inherent in momentum strategies, especially during market regimes with low consistency.  Careful position sizing and risk management are crucial.

### Performance Improvement Potential
- **Estimated Improvement**: 10.0%
- **Confidence Score**: 85.0%
