### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 12,
  "macd_slow": 30,
  "macd_signal": 11,
  "momentum_period": 20,
  "atr_period": 20,
  "volume_threshold": 2.0
}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy is failing because its parameters are too slow for the analyzed market, which is characterized as a 'bullish' trend with extremely low 'consistency' (-83.5). This indicates a choppy, non-committal uptrend where slow trend-following signals result in late entries and exits, causing significant losses and a high drawdown. The optimization goal is to increase the strategy's responsiveness to capture shorter-term price swings within this difficult environment.

1.  **MACD (10, 24, 8):** We are shortening all MACD periods. Shifting from (12, 30, 11) to (10, 24, 8) makes the indicator significantly more sensitive to recent price action. This should generate earlier entry signals to catch moves sooner and, crucially, earlier exit signals to mitigate losses when the choppy trend reverses.

2.  **Momentum & ATR (14, 16):** Reducing the `momentum_period` from 20 to 14 aligns the confirmation filter with the faster MACD signals. Shortening the `atr_period` makes the stop-loss (presumably based on ATR) more reactive to recent volatility, which can help cut losses more quickly during adverse moves, directly addressing the high max drawdown.

3.  **Volume Threshold (1.6):** The market exhibits a 'decreasing' volume trend, and the current threshold of 2.0 is likely filtering out too many valid trading opportunities, as evidenced by the low trade count (60). Lowering the threshold to 1.6 allows the strategy to participate in more moves that meet the technical criteria, even if they aren't high-volume breakouts. This increases the sample size and provides more opportunities for the faster parameters to generate profit.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 10,
  "macd_slow": 24,
  "macd_signal": 8,
  "momentum_period": 14,
  "atr_period": 16,
  "volume_threshold": 1.6
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Moderately volatile trending markets with frequent pullbacks
- Bullish or bearish markets with low trend consistency (choppy trends)
- Markets with decreasing overall volume where high-volume breakouts are rare

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk with the suggested faster parameters is over-trading and increased susceptibility to whipsaws in a purely range-bound or directionless market. By increasing sensitivity, we risk generating false signals if the market lacks any underlying directional bias. The lower volume threshold could also lead to entries on insignificant volume spikes that do not translate into sustained moves. These optimized parameters are tailored to the observed choppy but bullish market conditions; their performance may degrade significantly in a different market regime, such as low-volatility consolidation or a very strong, consistent trend. Rigorous out-of-sample and walk-forward testing is critical to validate these parameters and prevent overfitting.
