### Current Parameters Used

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 16,
  "macd_slow": 30,
  "macd_signal": 12,
  "momentum_period": 20,
  "atr_period": 20,

}
```

### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy is failing primarily due to a mismatch between its slow parameters and the market's erratic behavior. The optimization goal is to make the strategy more responsive and selective to improve signal quality and risk management.

1.  **MACD Parameter Adjustment (16,30,12 -> 12,26,9):** The existing MACD settings are too slow, causing late entries at the peak of short-term moves and late exits after a reversal has already occurred. Shifting to the more standard and responsive (12, 26, 9) configuration will allow the strategy to react more quickly to changes in momentum. This is critical for capturing trends earlier and avoiding the whipsaws that plagued the current version, directly targeting an improvement in the Win Rate and Profit Factor.

2.  **Risk & Confirmation Period Reduction (20 -> 14):** Shortening the `atr_period` from 20 to 14 will make the stop-loss calculations more sensitive to recent volatility. In a choppy market, this leads to tighter, more dynamic stops that cut losses faster, which is the most direct way to address the severe 39.63% max drawdown. Shortening the `momentum_period` to 14 aligns it with the faster MACD, ensuring that the confirmation indicator is in sync with the primary signal generator.

3.  **Volume Threshold Adjustment (1.8 -> 1.4):** The market data shows a decreasing volume trend. The high `volume_threshold` of 1.8 is likely too restrictive, filtering out potentially valid signals and contributing to the low trade count (58). Lowering the threshold to 1.4 increases the likelihood of finding valid entry points without being overly permissive, aiming to increase the number of high-quality trading opportunities and improve Total Return.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 12,
  "macd_slow": 26,
  "macd_signal": 9,
  "momentum_period": 14,
  "atr_period": 14,
  "volume_threshold": 1.4
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, consistent trending markets (either bullish or bearish)
- High momentum breakout scenarios following a consolidation period
- Markets with increasing or stable volume trends

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk of this strategy is its severe underperformance in choppy, non-trending, or inconsistently trending markets, as evidenced by the current backtest. The market analysis shows a highly inconsistent trend (consistency: -83.53), which is the classic environment where MACD-based strategies suffer from 'whipsaws'â€”generating frequent false signals that lead to numerous small losses and a high drawdown. The current max drawdown of 39.63% is unacceptable and points to a significant flaw in the risk management or signal generation logic for the tested market conditions. Furthermore, optimizing parameters based on a single historical period introduces a high risk of overfitting. These new parameters must be validated on out-of-sample data to ensure they are robust.
