### Optimization Recommendations

The current strategy is failing catastrophically despite operating in a strong 'bullish' trend. The root cause is the extremely low 'trend consistency' (-83.53), which indicates the market is choppy and prone to sharp pullbacks. The current 'fast' parameters (e.g., MACD 14/28) are reacting to this noise, resulting in premature entries and exits (whipsaws).

The optimization reasoning is to 'slow down' the strategy to make it less sensitive to short-term fluctuations and more responsive to the primary underlying trend:

1.  **MACD (16/30/12):** By increasing all MACD periods to the higher end of their optimization ranges, we create a much smoother MACD and signal line. This will reduce the number of crossovers, ensuring that signals are generated only by more sustained and significant price movements, thus improving signal quality.
2.  **Momentum Period (20):** A longer lookback period for momentum aligns the entry trigger with the more established, longer-term trend. This will help the strategy avoid entering trades based on short-lived counter-trend rallies or dips.
3.  **ATR Period (20):** Maintaining the long ATR period is crucial. It ensures that any stop-loss or take-profit calculations are based on a wider volatility window, resulting in wider stops that are not easily triggered by the market's choppiness.
4.  **Volume Threshold (1.8):** Increasing the volume threshold acts as a conviction filter. In a market with a decreasing volume trend, requiring a stronger volume spike (1.8x average) helps confirm that a breakout has genuine participation behind it, filtering out low-conviction, noisy moves.

### Suggested Parameter Adjustments

```json
{
  "macd_fast": 16,
  "macd_slow": 30,
  "macd_signal": 12,
  "momentum_period": 20,
  "atr_period": 20,
  "volume_threshold": 1.8
}
```

### Optimal Market Conditions
- Strong, consistent trending markets (bullish or bearish)
- High-conviction breakouts accompanied by increasing volume
- Markets with a clear directional bias and low choppiness

### Risk Assessment
The strategy's primary risk, demonstrated by its current performance, is whipsaw risk in volatile but inconsistent trends. The current parameters are too sensitive, leading to frequent false signals, a low win rate (28.28%), and a severe maximum drawdown (37.20%). The proposed 'slower' parameters aim to mitigate this by filtering out market noise, but this introduces lag risk. The strategy may enter a new trend late and exit after the peak, potentially missing significant portions of a move. This is a deliberate trade-off to improve signal quality and reduce drawdown. Furthermore, the strategy will inherently underperform in range-bound or consolidating markets where trend and momentum signals are unreliable. Any optimization carries a risk of overfitting; therefore, these new parameters must be validated on out-of-sample data.
